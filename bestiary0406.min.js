Ahkhats are bound to their structures via a special keystone that's intrinsically attuned to the ahkhat, and they cannot leave the premises of their own volition. Furthermore, ahkhats cannot move through or manipulate structurally damaged parts of their attuned buildings, so they have a vested interest in maintaining the integrity of their demesnes.

Ahkhat keystones are usually difficult to locate, and are sometimes protected by a locked or secret door, devious traps, or magical protections. The outward appearance is typically a carved icon of a humanoid figure, beneath which is written the ahkhat's name in Ancient Osiriani.

An ahkhat cannot approach within 10 feet of its keystone unless granted permission by someone who has successfully used the keystone. Once tamed by use of the keystone, the ahkhat typically assumes a passive or subservient attitude toward the creature that activated it, even after the duration of the charm effect has expired. The ahkhat perceives this creature as the master of the house. By use of its keystone, an ahkhat can be ordered to enter its keystone and remain there.

Upon sighting such prey, the beast uses its distress to lure victims near, so it can snatch them with its tail claw. Ahuizotls are particularly fond of feasting upon a victim's eyes, and their tail claws are particularly adept at swiping away such organs for the beasts to feed upon. Teeth and fingernails are another of the creature's favorite meals, and the appearance of mutilated bodies missing eyes, teeth, and nails along a river's banks is sure evidence of an ahuizotl attack.

Known for their iron-hard, wart-covered skin that varies from shades of deep blue to black and their claws like rusty blades, annis hags forgo much of the cunning and deceptiveness of their kind to revel in the more visceral evils of torture and slaughter. The typical annis hag stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs upward of 300 pounds. Dwelling in dark caves, tangled hollows, and cursed ruins deep within frozen swamps or icy moors, annis hags stalk forth by night to sow fear and hunt the unwary. Although possessed of cunning minds, annis prove more decadent than most other hags, frequently indulging in their taste for living flesh and the music of pleading screams. Unlike green hags, they use their ability to assume humanoid form via alter self not to infiltrate societies but to lure victims into a false sense of security before attacking-often posing as travelers in need of aid or pilgrims seeking to share a camp. Annis hags find the flesh of children, young animals, and the pure of heart particularly pleasing, both for the tenderness of such meals and for the sorrow such murders spread. After gorging themselves, these hags delight in stripping the skin from their victims, often garbing themselves in the grisly trophies. They are also known to retain and even preserve identifiable portions of their victims (such as heads) for later use in spreading misery. An annis who eats the children of a local farmer might keep the heads (or at least the faces) handy to return to the victims' parents, for example-often in the guise of an anonymous gift. The most insidious of annis hags present these gifts in ways that implicate friends or family in the victim's death. Like most hags, annis sometimes join covens of their repulsive sisters, though many prove resistant to such cooperation. They are particularly unlikely to join covens that already include other annis, though groups of related annis-typically horrible triplets-are not unknown. A typical annis coven consists of one annis leader along with two green hags or sometimes even a witch or two.

Ascomoids can grow to a width of 10 feet, but they rarely weigh more than 400 pounds. While ascomoids require no light to grow, they do require a moist environment. They do not keep traditional lairs, but often wander the same areas over and over, littering these routes with the bones of past victims. Although they are typically solitary creatures, ascomoids dwelling in areas of ample moisture with generous sources of food-or frequent unwitting passersby- sometimes form deadly clusters. Such colonies of these giant fungi often lurk in large caverns among other pallid vegetation. Given ascomoids' ability to detect vibrations, the slightest quake or potential footfall sets them rolling, turning their cavernous lairs into churning meat grinders. Bounding about violently, groups of ascomoids sometimes take hours to settle back down, unable to distinguish between the movements of prey and the tumbling of their own kind.

Those crushed by an ascomoid or who fall victim to an ascomoid's spores face a revolting end, their bodies becoming hosts to quick-growing colonies of rampant fungi. Immature ascomoid mold sprouts quickly, typically appearing within 24 hours. After 48 hours, such victims become so overgrown with this furry, brown-green mold that they can no longer be restored to life by raise dead, as their bodies are too vitally pervaded and thoroughly consumed by the swiftly spreading mold.

Their primary base of operations in Varisia is located in this district, a bronze-faced building with heavy doors emblazoned with sigils of three intertwined asps. The Aspis Consortium has had a presence in Magnimar for nearly a century, though agents have had to proceed more cautiously of late, following the recent founding of a Pathfinder lodge in the city. Aspis agents in Magnimar favor no particular class, and agents from all walks of life can be found throughout the city. Some are rogues or fighters, while others practice the arcane arts as sorcerers or wizards. Quite a few, however, come from the ranks of bards, utilizing their various skills, social graces, and musical talents to covertly extort buyers, to beat Pathfinders to major finds, or simply to steal such treasures out from under Pathfinders' very noses. As with Aspis headquarters in other parts of the Inner Sea, the leadership of Magnimar's Consortium is broken up into a strict hierarchy of power. The lowest and most common members are paid mercenaries who partake in the various odd jobs assigned by true Aspis agents, whether such tasks involve pillaging Thassilonian ruins or taking care of pesky competitors who would seek to hinder the Consortium's endeavors. Bronze agents are made up of Magnimar's dockworkers, freelancers, and lowly adventurers seeking money and improved status, while those agents wielding silver emblems organize the activities of their underlings throughout the regions surrounding the city. Only a couple gold agents operate in Magnimar, though their inf luence and power extends to nearly all the corners of Varisia, and their word is law as far as lesser agents are concerned. While the NPC depicted here represents a city-based agent who excels at espionage, deceit, and other urbane tactics, those working for the Aspis Consortium in Magnimar take myriad forms. The company has enlisted warlords and wizards alike, and even some adventuring groups find their way onto the Consortium's payroll-all it takes is the gumption and means to find lost treasures and bring them back to the auction house, as well as a certain lack of ethics and a strong sense of cupidity for those who wish to rise in rank.",dr:[],environment:"any (vista)",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["alertness","arcane strike","deceitful","weapon finesse"],hd:"5d8",hp:26,immunities:[],initiative:2,languages:["common","varisian"],melee:[{amount:1,bonus:[6],critmin:18,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+2",special:"",weapon:"+1 rapier"}],organization:"solitary, pair, or company (3-12)",race:"male human",ranged:[],reach:"5 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:0,circumstantial:[{bonus:4,circumstance:"bardic performance and language-dependent and sonic",type:""}]},reflex:{bonus:6,circumstantial:[{bonus:4,circumstance:"bardic performance and language-dependent and sonic",type:""}]},will:{bonus:5,circumstantial:[{bonus:4,circumstance:"bardic performance and language-dependent and sonic",type:""}]}},senses:["perception +10"],size:"medium",skills:{acrobatics:{bonus:7,circumstantial:[]},bluff:{bonus:5,circumstantial:[]},diplomacy:{bonus:11,circumstantial:[]},disguise:{bonus:12,circumstantial:[]},intimidate:{bonus:10,circumstantial:[]},"knowledge (local)":{bonus:7,circumstantial:[]},"knowledge (nobility)":{bonus:7,circumstantial:[]},perception:{bonus:10,circumstantial:[]},"perform (oratory)":{bonus:11,circumstantial:[]},"sense motive":{bonus:10,circumstantial:[]},"sleight of hand":{bonus:9,circumstantial:[]},stealth:{bonus:7,circumstantial:[]}},sla:[],space:"5 ft.",specialabilities:[],specialattacks:["bardic performance 15 rounds/day (countersong, distraction, fascinate, inspire competence +2, inspire courage +2)"],speed:["30 ft."],spellsknown:[],sq:"bardic knowledge +2, lore master 1/ day, versatile performance (oratory)",sr:{value:0,versus:""},subtype:["human"],treasure:"npc gear (chain shirt, +1 rapier, potions of cure light wounds [2], antitoxin, oil of taggit [2], sassone leaf residue [2], other treasure)",type:"humanoid",weaknesses:[],xp:"1200"},"attic whisperer":{abilityscores:{cha:17,con:NaN,dex:19,"int":14,str:9,wis:16},ac:{"flat-footed":14,normal:19,touch:16},alignment:["ne"],auras:["sobs (10 ft.)"],"class":[],cmb:{bonus:2,special:""},cmd:{bonus:17,special:""},cr:"4",defensiveabilities:[],description:"An attic whisperer spawns as the result of a lonely or neglected child's death.

Folklore holds that, much like the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk's physiology lends any credence to this claim.Basilisks live in nearly any terrestrial environment, from forest to desert, and their hides tend to match and ref lect their surroundings-a desert-dwelling basilisk might be tan or brown, while one that lives in a forest could be bright green. They tend to make their lairs in caves, burrows, or other sheltered areas, and these dens are often marked by statues of people and animals in lifelike poses-the petrified remains of those unfortunate enough to stumble across the basilisk.Basilisks have the ability to consume the creatures they petrify, their churning stomach acid dissolving and extracting nutrients from the stone, but the process is slow and inefficient, making them lazy and sluggish. As a result, basilisks rarely stalk prey or chase those who avoid their gaze, counting on their stealth and the element of surprise to keep them safe and fed. When not lying in wait for the small mammals, birds, and reptiles that normally make up their diet, basilisks spend their time sleeping in their lairs, and those brave enough to capture basilisks or hide treasure near them find that they make natural guardians and watchdogs.An adult basilisk is 13 feet long, with fully half of that made up by its long tail, and weighs 300 pounds. Some breeds have short, curved horns on their noses or small crests of bony growths topping their heads like crowns.Though normally solitary creatures, coming together only to mate and lay eggs, in particularly dangerous areas small groups may band together for protection and attack intruders en masse.For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume its young.Some legends suggest that a basilisk's blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.",dr:[],environment:"any",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["blind-fight","great fortitude","iron will","skill focus (perception)"],hd:"7d10+14",hp:52,immunities:[],initiative:-1,languages:[],melee:[{amount:1,bonus:[10],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d8+4",special:"",weapon:"bite"}],organization:"solitary, pair, or colony (3-6)",race:"",ranged:[],reach:"5 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:9,circumstantial:[]},reflex:{bonus:4,circumstantial:[]},will:{bonus:5,circumstantial:[]}},senses:["darkvision 60 ft.","low-light vision","perception +10"],size:"medium",skills:{perception:{bonus:10,circumstantial:[]},stealth:{bonus:10,circumstantial:[]}},sla:[],space:"5 ft.",specialabilities:[{description:"Turn to stone permanently (as flesh to stone), range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 15 negates.

Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a debilitating disease known for sapping the vitality of its victims. Because of this potent mix of teeming esurience and virulent pestilence, bloodhaze mosquitoes panic almost any community they threaten. Legends describe crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their flight from breeding pool to jungle interior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes' relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers under marginal control. A typical bloodhaze swarm contains more than 10,000 flying mosquitoes. Individually, each mosquito is smaller than a child's fingernail, yet together they form a terrifying assault.

They often appear as part of a rakshasa's retinue or secret network. Born to manipulate and murder, they revel in their work and delight in the sight of blood. Thus, dandasukas go about their work cheerfully, laughing as they manipulate foes and butcher victims. All dandasukas are restless and energetic. They crave activity and entertainment, preferring the sick and cruel to conventional fare. Dandasuka pranks are rarely amusing for the victim. Monstrous hunger gnaws at the hyperactive dandasuka's body, making the creature crave humanoid flesh and blood. When such blood is spilled, a dandasuka is often not able to contain its fiendish appetite. It might lick a bloody blade, lap up fallen drops, or even take a bite out of a fallen foe at the expense of a more tactically sound option in a fight. A dandasuka settles for other meat when it must, but it always prefers humanoid flesh. Murder and mayhem are not the only duties of a dandasuka. Stronger rakshasas dispatch dandasukas as emissaries and servants to allies. Despite their usual disorderly habits, they bargain good-naturedly and in good faith, only implying dire consequences for noncompliance. Dandasuka negotiators efficiently take care of impasses if no favorable resolution can be reached. Similarly, dandasuka retainers serving rakshasa allies curb their fiendish ways as best they can, though their employers would still do well to keep them amused and fed. One has to be careful of keeping dandasukas too pleased, however, since they are known to take unwanted initiative because of off-hand remarks, such as idle wishes that a certain person were dead. Dandasuka greed extends from amusements and food to wealth. All dandasukas love comfort, fine clothing, and shiny baubles.

When they are encountered aboveground, their affinity for forests (they particularly enjoy clambering around in tangled canopies) suggests that their original source might be some strange, deep underground cavern wherein magical jungles grow. The decapus is a fairly intelligent creature-an ambush predator that makes excellent use of its ability to weave magical visual illusions and to imitate the voices of other creatures it has heard speaking. Typical decapuses know only the Aklo tongue, but when they use their sound mimicry ability to imitate creatures speaking in other languages, they can typically form short (up to three words long) sentences even when imitating a language they don't actually know. The decapus's physical structure most resembles that of a bloated octopus with 10 tentacles. It lacks bones and takes its shape from its rubbery, muscular flesh. Most have sickly, olive skin patched with scraggly tangles of hair, with darker blue or purple coloration around their faces and crimson or orange tips to their tentacles. These tentacles are covered with tiny suction cups and hooks, affording them great skill at climbing or clutching prey. On the ground, though, they are slow, plodding creatures that flop and wriggle relatively inefficiently. As a result, they prefer regions like forest canopies, narrow fissures, stalactite forests, or other regions where they can use their climb speed. The decapus favors humanoid flesh over all other food; most are quite fond of gnome flesh in particular. This creature has an enormous appetite that often drives it to consume whatever food is available-the decapus is not above cannibalism when other food sources are scarce. For this reason, these monsters are largely solitary creatures, except when the urge to mate overwhelms their urge to feed. Females give birth to small litters of 2-4 live offspring. The females often need to defend them from the males, which, if left unsupervised, typically eat the newborn decapuses. The young mature rapidly, growing to full size after a mere 7 to 11 months, after which they depart to claim their own territories. Once a decapus reaches maturity, it can live to 100 years old-although their violent natures usually result in much shorter lifespans.

Within their native habitat, these oozes are particularly difficult to spot.

This instinct may be tied to the fact that they can stay relatively dormant for decades or even centuries, but eventually they need the life energy of warm-blooded creatures to fuel their strange locomotion. Since they dwell in unforgiving and underpopulated areas, it is easier for them to conserve energy and wait for prey rather than to try to track down warm-blooded creatures. After feeding, or when fully fed, these creatures tend to ignore other creatures unless attacked. Though freezing flows' crystalline construction can give the illusion that they are brittle, nothing is further from the truth.

A greater daemon may create a genthodaemon from a cacodaemon or one of the hunted (a dead soul trying to survive on Abaddon); however, most arise naturally from war-battered souls who band together as hunted, transforming into true daemons simultaneously when the group has cannibalized enough souls. Genthodaemons show unusual loyalty to others in their band, though this doesn't interfere with their obligations to more powerful daemons.

Despite their horrific undead appearance, this feature shames them the most, and they hide their feet from view. Ghuls, like ghouls and ghasts, haunt cemeteries and other places of the dead hoping to feed on corpses. They also hunt mourners and grave tenders, as they enjoy the taste of living prey as well as that of the dead. Selective in their diets, ghuls choose their victims by personality, believing innocence and youth taste more delicious than the barely palatable flesh of the bitter and old. Sometimes a ghul follows a funeral procession in hyena form, keeping a safe distance until the ceremony, whereupon it changes into its true form to attack and feast. Sorrow and despair taste as delicious as innocence to a ghul. While not directly affected by sunlight, ghuls despise its presence and only move about during the day if forced to by necessity. They primarily hunt at night, sometimes straying far from their graveyard lairs and burial caves in search of fresh prey to sate their hunger. The longer a ghul goes without feeding, the more ferocious and primal the creature becomes. A well-sated ghul organizes with others of its kind and lesser undead, tormenting nearby towns and settlements. A ghul involved with this level of organization often has a scattered set of lairs throughout the desert. These allow the ghul to strike far from its home lair and hide again without having to travel during the blistering daylight sun. When a ghul goes for too long without feeding, it becomes increasingly feral and violent- its statistics don't change, but it grows less concerned with fleeing combat, even when it is obviously outmatched.

They are aggressive, carnivorous, highly territorial, and incredibly strong. Worse, their four muscular arms are capable of inf licting incredible damage on anything that falls into their clutches. Their exotic appearance makes them popular creatures in certain cities as attractions in gladiatorial combats, either starved and pitted against each other, or set against gladiators eager to increase their fame and notoriety. One who kills a girallon is all but assured of fame, yet most battles against these ferocious beasts end poorly for those foolish enough to attempt to single-handedly defeat one. An adult girallon is 8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white fur. It weighs roughly 800 pounds. Girallons live in troops led by a dominant male. Solitary girallons are usually young males looking to start their own troop. Girallons are very territorial and tend to attack intruders without warning, including strangers of their own kind. Groups of girallons may attack in a line to drive prey toward a cliff or other hazard, or quietly form a ring around their target and suddenly close in. While most girallons are little more than beasts, ancient carvings and the oral traditions of some tribes hint that the girallon wasn\'t always the stupid creature it is today. According to these legends, the first girallons were men who called upon savage demon gods to gain great strength, yet in so doing abandoned their humanity. With each generation, these first girallons grew more and more savage and feral, and the same legends maintain that these intelligent girallons still dwell in the darkest part of the jungle. In addition to their intellects, these girallons retain a vast appetite for cruelty. Called "high girallons," these creatures are almost always chaotic evil, and have Intelligence scores of 6 or higher. An intelligent girallon generally speaks whatever language the local humans speak. Often, they become leaders of unusually large troops of their less-intelligent kin, inhabit strange ruined cities in the jungle or mountains, and conduct raids on villages for food and treasure. Some primitive tribes worship these girallons as the agents of evil gods or demons, and a few high girallons have been known to work for or even breed with tribal orcs, inspiring legends of four-armed "white orcs."',dr:[],environment:"warm forests",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["improved initiative","iron will","skill focus (perception)","toughness"],hd:"7d10+35",hp:73,immunities:[],initiative:7,languages:[],melee:[{amount:1,bonus:[10],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+4",special:"",weapon:"bite"},{amount:4,bonus:[10],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d4+4",special:"rend",weapon:"claws"}],organization:"solitary or company (5-8)",race:"",ranged:[],reach:"10 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:9,circumstantial:[]},reflex:{bonus:8,circumstantial:[]},will:{bonus:5,circumstantial:[]}},senses:["darkvision 60 ft.","low-light vision","scent","perception +11"],size:"large",skills:{climb:{bonus:12,circumstantial:[]},perception:{bonus:11,circumstantial:[]},stealth:{bonus:5,circumstantial:[]}},sla:[],space:"10 ft.",specialabilities:[],specialattacks:["rend (4 claws, 1d4+6)"],speed:["40 ft.","climb 40 ft."],spellsknown:[],sq:"",sr:{value:0,versus:""},subtype:[],treasure:"none",type:"magical beast",weaknesses:[],xp:"2400"},"glacier toad":{abilityscores:{cha:6,con:20,dex:13,"int":5,str:23,wis:12},ac:{"flat-footed":18,normal:19,touch:10},alignment:["n"],auras:["bitter cold (20 ft.)"],"class":[],cmb:{bonus:14,special:"+18 grapple;"},cmd:{bonus:25,special:"29 vs. trip"},cr:"6",defensiveabilities:[],description:"Glacier toads are strange, magical cousins of the more common giant toads.

While they can sometimes be trained or befriended to serve as mounts, griffons have no inherent affinity for humanoids, and frequently come into bloody conf lict with civilized races over their attempts to secure their favorite food-horse flesh. City folk may marvel at the trained griffon's stately manner and 25-foot wingspan, but those farmers forced to share territory with its wild kin know to hurry home and secure their barns when the beasts' hunting shrieks split the sky. Griffons mate for life, and will often search for years to take vengeance over a slain mate or child. It was likely this innate stubbornness and fierce loyalty that first brought them into domestic use as mounts and guardians of treasure hoards. Despite the inherent danger, trade in captured griffons and stolen eggs is brisk, with their eggs worth up to 3,500 gp apiece and live young twice that. Characters eager for griffon mounts, however, should note that buying or forcibly domesticating intelligent creatures like griffons is still recognized as slavery by most good deities, and winning a griffon's allegiance of its own free will is no easy task. Reaching a mutually agreeable accord (or even a friendship) is a much more elegant and safe route to securing a griffon mount. Before it can be ridden in combat, a griffon requires practice bearing the weight of its rider. In order to be trained successfully, a griffon must first be helpful toward its trainer (possibly requiring a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal check). After that, 6 weeks of practice and a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check is sufficient for the beast to be comfortable with its burden, and due to their intelligence, trained griffons can be treated as knowing every trick listed in the Handle Animal skill description, possibly even responding to new, simple requests made in Common. Griffons can carry up to 300 pounds as a light load, 600 pounds as a medium load, and 900 pounds as a heavy load. Riding a griffon requires an exotic saddle.",dr:[],environment:"temperate hills",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["iron will","skill focus (perception)","weapon focus (bite)"],hd:"5d10+15",hp:42,immunities:[],initiative:2,languages:["common (cannot speak)"],melee:[{amount:1,bonus:[8],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+3",special:"",weapon:"bite"},{amount:2,bonus:[7],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+3",special:"",weapon:"talons"}],organization:"solitary, pair, or pride (6-10)",race:"",ranged:[],reach:"5 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:7,circumstantial:[]},reflex:{bonus:6,circumstantial:[]},will:{bonus:4,circumstantial:[]}},senses:["darkvision 60 ft.","low-light vision","scent","perception +12"],size:"large",skills:{acrobatics:{bonus:10,circumstantial:[]},fly:{bonus:6,circumstantial:[]},perception:{bonus:12,circumstantial:[]}},sla:[],space:"10 ft.",specialabilities:[],specialattacks:["pounce","rake (2 claws +7, 1d4+3)"],speed:["30 ft.","fly 80 ft.

They relish the destructive forces of their storms, and can manipulate a storm's energy to rain down hailstones to pelt the area. Their command of the winds also aids them in flight. They are never impeded by storm winds, but instead ride them, often achieving top speeds by accelerating the wind currents around them. Due to the nature of their origin, halas are highly possessive. A hala will often refer to the storm clouds they marshal as \"my storm.\" A hala is predisposed to grab any item it finds particularly desirable, and will actively pillage regions that its storm passes over. The desire to take from others remains so prevalent in the hala's nature that it often carries large sacks in which to place all the items it takes during its flights.",name:"ecology"},{description:"Halas can be seen throughout the Abyss, roaming the skies in servitude to Pazuzu as his dedicated scout force.

Despite the duty to return to High M'Vania, halas are solitary demons, distrusting all others, especially other hala demons, fearing that they will attempt to take their pillaged possessions. Therefore, most halas live in isolated, remote areas where they maintain their hoards of ill-gotten gains. Pazuzu values his hala minions not only for the intelligence they gather on the activities of his enemies in the Abyss, but also for the chaos and destruction they bring on the winds. He is especially fond of sending halas to the Material Plane to ravage the countryside with storms and hail. As in the Abyss, halas on the Material Plane prefer to reside in remote areas. The lair of a hala is often located in a hidden cave in an isolated mountain range, or in the hollow of a giant, ancient tree deep in a forest or swamp. While hala demons have a general dislike for or distrust of nearly all creatures, they have an especially strong fear and hatred of two creatures: eagles and dragons. Eagles have an innate response to attack and drive a hala from the skies, possibly due to the threat the hala represents to the eagle's territory and offspring.

Hernes superficially resemble the humans from whom they descend, save for the many-pointed antlers which project from their brows. Though they are creatures of flesh and blood, hernes are infused with the spirit of the wild hunt. For the most part, hernes live as humble woodsfolk, reaping the bounty of the forest by their own hands. Yet they are also protectors of the forest, hunting those who abuse it or dare to claim ownership of its reaches. When hernes' anger is roused, they become the avenging spirits the stories make them out to be. Hernes tend to be tall and lean.

Hieracosphinxes attack other sphinxes whenever they have them at a disadvantage. Male sphinxes of other species they tear to shreds or drive away, whereas they prefer to leave gynosphinxes ravaged but alive. The other species of sphinx likewise hold nothing but disdain for hieracosphinxes, and typically attack these vile beasts on sight.

They have no use for banter and riddles, making most efforts at diplomacy rather ineffective, but can be convinced to call off their attacks by convincing shows of force coupled with information on the location of weaker prey or a gynosphinx. Though poor fliers, they still prefer to fight from the air, the better to escape if the combat turns against them.

They make such attacks night after night until the settlement is destroyed or the resistance becomes too fierce, at which point the horde disbands and each karkinoi makes its own way in the sea.

(Those trees are protected by different kami, if at all.) A kodama takes a single tree under its protection; typically, all of the trees in a forest that are protected by kodama are clustered together in one particular area. A kodama in its physical form resembles a barely humanoid creature with only the vaguest of features on its semispherical head. A tree kami is 3 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds. While one might expect the kami of something as large as a tree to itself be larger, the fact that forests are made up of so many trees tends to diminish the singular "presence" any single tree might have. In cases where a tree is particularly ancient or immense, however, the kodama associated with it is much larger-statistics for such rare kodama can be generated by advancing the kodama given here by several Hit Dice and increasing its size-theoretically, a Colossal kodama with more than 20 Hit Dice could exist somewhere in the world. Not all kodama increase in power by gaining racial Hit Dice, though, as some instead progress by gaining class levels, particularly levels of druid, though a rare few kodama kami-those possessed of minds more ordered and structured than is normal for their race-take the path of the monk. Kodama are more curious about visitors than most kami, and often manifest their physical bodies simply to watch and observe newcomers to their groves. A kodama usually manifests on the far side of its tree, or in the shadows of the undergrowth, so that it can slowly step out into visibility to quietly observe with its distracting, empty-eyed gaze. This gaze can be particularly unnerving.

This attention doesn't mean that a lar will aid a home, but merely that it has heard the prayer, and it might yet decide that its philosophies and virtues are incompatible with the supplicant. If such is the case, the lar quietly ignores the prayer, and the petitioner's chance to gain a lar's attention resets to 0%, all entirely unknown to the mortal.When a lar does accept an invitation, it may immediately plane shift to the associated statua, claiming it as its own.A lar typically makes some subtle acknowledgement that it has come, perhaps slightly altering its statua's appearance or lighting candles upon its arrival.

She knows the workings of her ship inside out, often having had a hand in its construction. If the ship needs repairs in the midst of a journey, she proves herself a skilled carpenter and sail maker. If a longship is caught in one of ferocious storms that frequently lash the Steaming Sea, the captain's determination and shouted commands urging all hands to row for their lives are often the only things that prevent the ship from capsizing. Many longship captains prefer to follow coastlines, and at night have their boats seek safe harbor so that the crew can sleep in tents on the nearby shore-in such cases, the captain herself claims the privilege of the sleeping onboard, possibly with an honor guard or skeleton crew to prevent thieves or accidents. If an enemy attacks during the night, the high-walled hull of the ship can serve as an impromptu fortification. In a naval battle, a longboat captain directs both the ship's course and her crew's tactics, all while personally raining down a shower of deadly arrows on the enemy vessel. Most longboat captains are certainly capable in melee combat, but prefer to issue orders and provide support with their arrows from a vantage point from which they can observe the whole battle-often the bows of their ships.

Employing their innate cunning, minotaurs use their maze lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way out. Only when despair has truly set in does the minotaur move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of slaying the beasts.

Their malleable bodies allow them to seep through cracks and holes far smaller than the space they fill.Creatures dwelling below ground often attempt to seal up any such cracks to fortify their lairs against ochre jellies.An ochre jelly's highly specialized acid only dissolves flesh. This discovery has led many poisoners and hack alchemists to search out specimens for their tinkering.Some specialized weapons have resulted from these experiments that target the living body in wicked ways.Rumors of a slow-release poison that breaks down the cellular walls in living creatures surfaced a few years ago, but its creator guards the secret with his life.Notes in a long-forgotten tome mention a burial practice used in faraway places that resembles cremation.Instead of burning the corpse to ashes, the practitioners seal the body into a stone sarcophagus with an ochre jelly so it can dissolve the body. Afterward, the morticians place the ochre jelly into a large canopic jar, complete with a bronze plaque naming the deceased. This practice protects items entombed with the body (which is quickly reduced to nothing but a polished skeleton), and the creature's essence, it is believed, still rides along with the living jelly.Ochre jellies stand about 6 inches tall, spread out to a little over 10 feet in diameter, and weigh upward of 2,600 pounds. When in combat, they tend to pile up upon themselves and exude long, dripping pseudopods to slam and grapple anything that moves.Although the typical ochre jelly has stats as presented here, in the deepest reaches of the underground world these mindless predators can grow to enormous sizes.Perhaps more disturbing, though, are rumors of ochre jellies that have developed additional methods of capturing prey.

Otyughs spend most of their time in these filthy dens, which they keep constantly filled with carrion, dung, and worse sorts of stinking eff luvia.Intelligent creatures dwelling in subterranean areas near an otyugh often form a partnership of convenience with the disgusting beast. These creatures gladly provide their refuse and piles of raw meat to the otyugh, transforming the creature into an effective form of trash disposal. In return, the otyugh leaves its benefactors alone, and does not attack them, possibly even acting as a guardian.The most horrifying thing to most races about the notorious otyugh is not the nature of its diet or its choice of lairs, but rather that a creature with an otyugh's tastes can be anything other than a mindless scavenger. In fact, otyughs are surprisingly intelligent, and often quite eager to form alliances with those who offer them a steady supply of delicious diversions in the form of offal and waste.Most otyughs understand the fact that other creatures find them unpleasant and hideous, but few really care.",dr:[],environment:"any underground",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["alertness","toughness","weapon focus (tentacle)"],hd:"6d8+12",hp:39,immunities:["disease"],initiative:0,languages:["common"],melee:[{amount:1,bonus:[7],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d8+4",special:"disease",weapon:"bite"},{amount:2,bonus:[3],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+2",special:"grab",weapon:"tentacles"}],organization:"solitary, pair, or cluster (3-4)",race:"",ranged:[],reach:"10 ft.

However, most concur that at some point in the distant past, a deranged wizard created the original specimens by crossing an owl with a bear-perhaps as proof of some insane concept about the nature of life, but possibly out of sheer lunacy.Whatever the original purpose of such a freakish creation as the owlbear, the creature bred true and has become quite wellestablished in woodlands across the world, where it plays a key role in a region's ecosystem as an apex predator.Owlbears are notoriously bloodthirsty killers, well known for their short tempers, aggression, and savage nature. They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths.Many scholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed.Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the prey available near their lairs.Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while they search for prey. A typical owlbear lair contains 1d6 juveniles, which can fetch a price of up to 3,000 gp apiece in many city markets.While it is considered impossible to truly domesticate owlbears due to their feral natures, they can still be used as guardians if contained within an area but allowed to roam and hunt freely there. Professional animal trainers charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train an owlbear into a serviceable guardian that can obey simple commands (DC 23 for a juvenile creature; DC 30 for a fully grown adult).A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weighs up to 1,500 pounds.",dr:[],environment:"temperate forests",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["improved initiative","great fortitude","skill focus (perception)"],hd:"5d10+20",hp:47,immunities:[],initiative:5,languages:[],melee:[{amount:2,bonus:[8],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+4",special:"grab",weapon:"claws"},{amount:1,bonus:[8],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+4",special:"",weapon:"bite"}],organization:"solitary, pair, or pack (3-8)",race:"",ranged:[],reach:"5 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:10,circumstantial:[]},reflex:{bonus:5,circumstantial:[]},will:{bonus:2,circumstantial:[]}},senses:["darkvision 60 ft.","low-light vision","scent","perception +12"],size:"large",skills:{perception:{bonus:12,circumstantial:[]}},sla:[],space:"10 ft.",specialabilities:[],specialattacks:[],speed:["30 ft."],spellsknown:[],sq:"",sr:{value:0,versus:""},subtype:[],treasure:"incidental",type:"magical beast",weaknesses:[],xp:"1200"},pachycephalosaurus:{abilityscores:{cha:5,con:17,dex:15,"int":2,str:22,wis:12},ac:{"flat-footed":15,normal:17,touch:11},alignment:["n"],auras:[],"class":[],cmb:{bonus:10,special:""},cmd:{bonus:22,special:""},cr:"4",defensiveabilities:[],description:"",dr:[],environment:"warm or temperate plains",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["improved bull rush","power attack","run"],hd:"5d8+15",hp:37,immunities:[],initiative:2,languages:[],melee:[{amount:1,bonus:[8],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"2d6+9",special:"",weapon:"slam"}],organization:"solitary or pair",race:"",ranged:[],reach:"10 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:7,circumstantial:[]},reflex:{bonus:6,circumstantial:[]},will:{bonus:2,circumstantial:[]}},senses:["low-light vision","scent","perception +8"],size:"large",skills:{perception:{bonus:8,circumstantial:[]},stealth:{bonus:2,circumstantial:[]}},sla:[],space:"10 ft.",specialabilities:[{description:"When a pachycephalosaurus hits a target with its slam attack at the end of a charge, it can initiate a bull rush as a free action to move the struck target back in the same direction as the dinosaur's charge.

This acidic substance is expelled from the phycomid whenever it senses movement nearby, and seasoned adventurers can often trick a phycomid into giving away its true nature by simulating movement within range of the fungus. Less fortunate encounters are typically marked by large infestations of phycomids growing among a scattered collection of dead bodies. Because of the filthy environment in which this fungus thrives, goblins are one of the few races that have learned to coexist with phycomids. Not content to simply give the fungi a wide berth, these foolish goblins actually harvest the phycomids, prodding them into positions in their warrens where they can serve as guards and sentinels, utilizing long poles they call \"slime sticks\" or placing delicious-smelling carrion to attract the fungus to a desired position. Although phycomids are deadly to eat, many goblin tribes view those who eat a phycomid mushroom and survive as great heroes. Needless to say, most goblin lairs that attempt to utilize phycomids as guardians eventually become nothing more than phycomid lairs-a goblin tribe's luck can only hold up for so long, after all.",dr:[],environment:"any underground",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:[""],hd:"6d8+12",hp:39,immunities:["acid","plant traits"],initiative:0,languages:[],melee:[],organization:"solitary or infestation (2-8)",race:"",ranged:[{amount:1,bonus:[5],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"2d6 acid",special:"spores",weapon:"acid pellet"}],reach:"5 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:7,circumstantial:[]},reflex:{bonus:2,circumstantial:[]},will:{bonus:2,circumstantial:[]}},senses:["tremorsense 30 ft.","perception +0"],size:"small",skills:{},sla:[],space:"5 ft.",specialabilities:[{description:"A phycomid attacks by firing a glob of acid from one of its several mushroom-like stalks.

In their natural forms, raijus measure about 3-1/2 feet long and weigh 40 pounds, but they often take the form of small mammals when not on the Plane of Air. They can be still recognized as raijus in this form, however, as they bear markings suggestive of jagged lightning.",name:"shocking burst (su)"},{description:"",name:""},{description:"<br/> Raijus are extraplanar creatures that have little organization on their home plane, roaming and romping as little more than wild animals in their dangerous planar wilderness. On the Material Plane, they gravitate toward areas where storms are frequent, or where the effects of lightning are apparent. This means they frequently occupy the windward sides of mountains and wet forests, eagerly making small dens in the trunks of lightning-blasted trees or scorched, rocky crevices. Raijus can live on the Material Plane indefinitely, though all seek ways they might return to the Elemental Plane of Air. Those separated from their native plane rarely manage to find their way home without the intervention of some other being. Although life on the Material Plane often means a raiju will never encounter others of its kind again, few seem to realize this fact, or, if they do, become despondent over it. Rather, many raijus adopt the habits and communities of the creatures they spend the most time imitating and live as such creatures-except, of course, during violent lightning storms. Many believe that despite their destructive natures, raijus are good luck. This belief comes from the creatures' propensity for finding warm spots to nestle into and rest in during the lazy times between storms. One story tells of a raiju that found a snug spot in the navel of a sleeping giant. The giant was exhausted after a day of tromping on a local town and stealing away an entire year's harvest of rice, so it didn't even notice the sleeping creature. When the giant finally awoke and felt the dozing creature's claws on its belly, it flew into a panicked rage. The sudden activity startled the sleeping raiju, and it immediately summoned a storm and called down lightning, which promptly electrocuted the giant-killing the villain on the spot. When the curious townsfolk saw the brief, explosive storm nearby, they stopped rebuilding their homes and came to investigate. What they found was a charred giant and a sleepy raiju, nestled amid their stolen rice. Raijus have been considered lucky spirits ever since, though many refuse to sleep face up during lighting storms lest their bellies seem like a comfortable place for a raiju to rest. <br/>",name:"habitat & society"},{description:"<br/> This rarer variant of the raiju dwells upon the Plane of Fire, in regions filled with smoke and wracked by firestorms and endless volcanic eruptions.

The exact number of legs on a particular rast is seemingly a random trait. Strangely, these tangled limbs do not support the creature, but rather hang twitching and waving beneath it as the rast floats through the air with an easy grace, only reaching out to manipulate objects or-more often-to slash at its prey.Though rasts do not appear to have any spoken language, they display a degree of intelligence that places them above mere animals, and use this innate cunning to aid in their hunts. As prey is scarce in the barren, ashy deserts of the Plane of Fire where they make their home, rasts prefer to hunt in packs, swarming through the skies like schools of fish, their movements precise and coordinated despite their thrashing limbs. When they come across a likely target, they descend en masse, paralyzing those foes susceptible to their gaze and then abandoning them temporarily to focus on any opponents that remain mobile and dangerous, slashing with their claws and latching on with thick-lipped mouths to suck their victims' blood and viscera. Though each rast has roughly a dozen limbs, it can only control up to four at any given time, leaving the others to dangle uselessly.Rasts make their homes in small ashen burrows, no more than holes scooped out by the thrashing of their claws, and bear their squirming young live.

Although they prefer to charge into combat, a schir's natural jumping ability makes it a nimble enemy, capable of using its surroundings astutely. A schir will often jump on top of rocks, crumbling walls, or any other high place to hack with its disease-ridden halberd. For all of schirs' capabilities, their spitefulness makes them distrustful of any creature that has not proven its greater power and strength numerous times. A schir set loose upon the Material Plane quickly seeks to set itself up as a leader of its own army- often, schirs seek out tribes of savage humanoids and attempt to replace the current leaders.

The upper body of a sea cat is that of a typical great cat-a lion, tiger, leopard, or cheetah-complete with a pair of clawed paws capable of rending the flesh from its prey. In place of back legs, however, the sea cat has a sleek and powerful tail that allows it to move quickly and silently through the water. While only the back half of a sea cat looks fishlike, its entire body from the neck down is covered in fine scales and fins. Among individual sea cats, these scales vary greatly in color and pattern, often inf luenced by the primary habitat of a given specimen; the most common sea cats, have bright coloration in striped or spotted patterns. A typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs upward of 800 pounds. Sea cats can survive in both fresh and salt water, though most live in the ocean, where they can hunt a varied and consistent supply of food. A sea cat's diet typically consists of fish, crustaceans, and aquatic mammals (including seals and otters), but the creature's overpowering predatory and territorial instincts often lead it to attack ocean birds, humanoids, and even other aquatic predators like sharks and crocodiles. Coastal fishermen in areas where sea cats are known to dwell watch vigilantly for the predators, because the beasts have learned that netted or hooked prey is easier to kill and steal from the line. Sea cats breathe air, not water. When not hunting they can be found on coastal rocks, coral islands, or even isolated beaches sunning themselves and digesting their most recent meals. Whether hunting or protecting its territory, a sea cat generally attacks immediately upon discovering a target, even when faced with a much larger or more dangerous foe.

In such cases, short swords, punching daggers, glaives, and great clubs prove most common. Only the rarest of spartoi have been known to arise brandishing ranged weapons, their undead forms seeming to lack the coordination for such arms.

Even spartoi apparently risen from rival nations or cultures seem to forget all past rivalries in death. The mind of a spartolos is a mind possessed by a will to do battle and a skill or instinct seemingly inherent in the bones of great warriors, actual vestiges of personality lingering on only in the rarest cases. Even those spartoi retaining some hint of their former personalities seem interested only in completing their master's will and swiftly returning to their rightful place in death.

This is a sight-based effect.<br/>Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalides stalk the arid plains and coastlines of Golarion in ravenous swarms, shredding warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their bladed feathers and dagger-like beaks. From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other longnecked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake.Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon.The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help.Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms.",name:"dazzle (ex)"},{description:"<br/> Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean.Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock.Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms.",name:"ecology"},{description:"<br/> Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watering holes, rivers, and coastal cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or water so near to the dangerous birds' nests.

Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles.When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land.Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.",name:"habitat & society"}],specialattacks:["bleed (1)","dazzle","distraction (dc 15)"],speed:["10 ft.","fly 60 ft.

The tentamort's method of attack is to grab its prey with its constricting tentacle and sting the grappled target with the other. Tentamort poison is particularly horrific, as it swiftly liquefies the creature's internal organs into a rancid slurry the monster can then drink with the same stinger, siphoning out the fluid with foul sucking sounds. Larger creatures often require multiple stings (and multiple failed saving throws against the venom) before they can be fully absorbed by a tentamort. Tentamorts are almost mindless, possessing just enough intellect to make crude animal judgments about peril and food. Once a tentamort has grabbed prey, it tends to focus entirely on that creature, ignoring attacks upon it from other sources as long as its current victim remains a source of nutrition. After a tentamort finishes consuming a creature, all that typically remains are the bones and skin.A well-fed tentamort uses the hollow corpse of its meal as a sort of incubator for its eggs, injecting the body with a caviar-like mass of black eggs that mature in the rotting carcass for several weeks until a dozen or so hand-sized tentamorts hatch and crawl out of their host's orifices. Depending upon the availability of other prey, anywhere from one to six of these may survive, feeding on rats and Tiny vermin, until they eventually grow to adulthood. Tentamort young look like dark blue starfish with a single red eye in the center-they do not possess their longer, specialized tentacles until they mature.A young tentamort often attaches itself to a larger predator, clinging to it much the same way a remora clings to a shark, dropping off to feed innocuously on its host's kills while the creature sleeps.Some tentamorts grow much larger than their human-sized kin. Known as greater tentamorts, these ogre-sized creatures have at least 10 Hit Dice and are Large sized. Their two specialized tentacles grow to 20 feet long, providing the creature with greater reach than a Large monster normally possesses. Greater tentamorts are never found in groups, for these creatures can only achieve such monstrous size through cannibalism, as if there were some key nutrient in another tentamort's body that allows them to exceed their typical physical limitations. Some of these creatures have mutations giving them two tentacles and two stingers. Yet the most disturbing quality possessed by these monsters is their unexpected intellect-greater tentamorts are often as intelligent as humans, or more so. They cannot speak, but possess an eerie form of telepathy that works only upon creatures they are in physical contact with-a feature they often use to \"chat\" with their food as they eat.",dr:[],environment:"any marshes or underground",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["improved initiative","lightning reflexes","weapon focus (tentacle)"],hd:"6d8+12",hp:39,immunities:[],initiative:5,languages:[],melee:[{amount:1,bonus:[6],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+2",special:"poison",weapon:"sting"},{amount:1,bonus:[2],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+1",special:"grab",weapon:"tentacle"}],organization:"solitary, pair, or brood (3-6)",race:"",ranged:[],reach:"10 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:4,circumstantial:[]},reflex:{bonus:5,circumstantial:[]},will:{bonus:7,circumstantial:[]}},senses:["all-around vision","blindsense 30 ft.","darkvision 60 ft.","perception +11"],size:"medium",skills:{climb:{bonus:10,circumstantial:[]},perception:{bonus:11,circumstantial:[]}},sla:[],space:"5 ft.",specialabilities:[{description:"Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 2 rounds; effect 1d4 Con plus nausea; cure 1 save.<br/>",name:"poison (ex)"}],specialattacks:["constrict (1d6+1)"],speed:["20 ft.","climb 20 ft."],spellsknown:[],sq:"",sr:{value:0,versus:""},subtype:[],treasure:"incidental",type:"aberration",weaknesses:[],xp:"1200"},"terra-cotta soldier":{abilityscores:{cha:1,con:NaN,dex:16,"int":1,str:16,wis:11},ac:{"flat-footed":16,normal:19,touch:13},alignment:["n"],auras:[],"class":[],cmb:{bonus:11,special:""},cmd:{bonus:24,special:""},cr:"6",defensiveabilities:[],description:"",dr:["5/bludgeoning"],environment:"any",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["improved initiative","two weapon fighting","weapon focus (longsword","shortsword)"],hd:"8d10+20",hp:64,immunities:["construct traits","fire"],initiative:7,languages:[],melee:[{amount:1,bonus:[10,5],critmin:19,critmult:2,damage:"1d8+3",special:"",weapon:"longsword"},{amount:1,bonus:[10],critmin:19,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+1",special:"",weapon:"short sword"},{amount:2,bonus:[11],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d6+3",special:"",weapon:"slams"}],organization:"solitary, troop (3-12), or army (13+)",race:"",ranged:[],reach:"5 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:2,circumstantial:[]},reflex:{bonus:5,circumstantial:[]},will:{bonus:2,circumstantial:[]}},senses:["darkvision 60 ft.","low-light vision","perception +8"],size:"medium",skills:{perception:{bonus:8,circumstantial:[]}},sla:[],space:"5 ft.",specialabilities:[{description:"After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a terra-cotta soldier's weapons automatically gain the benefits of keen weapon (CL 6th).

Whether patrolling the perimeter of the hive or protecting its queen and seers from attackers, soldiers are a crucial asset ensuring a colony's survival, and so it makes sense that they compose the majority of thriae populations. While not as spiritually powerful as their seer and queen kin, soldiers possess remarkable agility and skill with the bow. Guards remain stationed in pairs outside doors to important areas, such as the meditation chambers of seers and the enormous private quarters of the queen, and when their duties take them outside the walls of the hive, they travel in large convoys. A thriae soldier's stinger carries within it especially potent venom similar to that of giant bees, and the soldier can easily apply this poison to her weapons.

Regardless of the type, all thriae weapons and armors are expertly crafted, made of steel and gilded with intricate decorations of gold and amber-hued gems. Thriae soldiers are often talented artisans as well as warriors, and most create their own weapons to bear in combat.

Loquacious when addressed with the proper respect, they make excellent heralds and emissaries for more powerful beings, and often enjoy posing as such even when operating on their own. When riled, however, tojanidas make fearsome opponents, violent and eager juggernauts with snapping jaws and clacking pincers.

While they harbor no fear of darkness and certainly see its value when tormenting mortals, they view it largely as a waste, seeking to dispel even the most fleeting shadow with an explosion of flame.",name:"ecology"},{description:"<br/> Most ukobachs originate from the flaming canals of Dis or the fiery pits of Phlegethon. Although rarely born from Moloch's crematoriums at the heart of Citadel Ba'al, hordes of ukobach furnace keepers tend the flames of the archdevil's ceremonial ovens. Devastating ukobach engineers also tinker in the foundries at the heart of Phlegethon, creating ingenious devices of intentional or incidental immolation-some infernal rumors claim a particularly insidious ukobach inspired the invention of the first fireworks, leaving these devils with a universal love of such creations.On the mortal plane, ukobachs gravitate to cities.While many metropolises prove ill prepared to defend against the flames these devils delight in spreading, most ukobachs take more subtle approaches, finding lairs in abandoned smithies, large furnaces, stone ruins, and other places likely to survive the occasional errant flame.While indisputably pyromaniacal, ukobachs are more than merely crazed marauders. Seeing a small hovel, pile of leaves, or alley cat burn is nothing to creatures born from the flames of Hell. Rather, they enjoy the order and progression of flames, exalting in striking the spark that ignites a wildfire, upturning the lantern that sets a whole city quarter aflame, or immolating the leader whose death results in the dispersal of a formerly devout congregation. Further satisfying their methodological obsessions, ukobachs prefer setting elaborate traps for their victims over direct combat, often turning whole structures into burning deathtraps, trapping and retrapping the same location, or setting obvious snares that cause their quarries to overlook more devious ambushes.These impish devils understand the use of flammable fluids and materials well, often employing barrels of oil, casks of alcohol, heaps of coal, and even alchemical items like tindertwigs in their creations.Among diabolists, it is said that all ukobachs know the secret of creating berith, an alchemical element by which any material might be distilled into gold. Stories tell of ukobachs trading knowledge of this element for wild prices or only after an alchemist gathers components from exotic lands. Such tales often offer blatant moral lessons and warnings against these unnatural obsessions, such as the Taldan author and former alchemist Smardina's cryptic and symbol-laden work Shagreen, wherein an obsessed alchemist adventures across the world and ultimately trades an ukobach 23 years of his life, only to find his age and journeys have made his hands too crippled to work-he dies soon after and is dragged to Hell in a golden coffin.",name:"habitat & society"},{description:"<br/> Ukobachs prove unusually congenial when it comes to answering the summons of many diabolists, especially those with an obvious creative streak, interest in alchemy, or queries regarding the inventions of Hell.Any diabolist who draws the magic circle necessary to bind an ukobach with mercury or silver powder, or who lights their diabolical summoning with chemical fire rather than normal oil or tinder, increases how difficult an ukobach finds it to escape from the magical trap by +2.Additionally, a diabolist gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to obtain an ukobach's service if the task involves creating alchemical or metallurgical works, or otherwise involves fire.In addition, ukobachs who know and favor their summoner sometimes bring gifts with them from Hell. While on the surface such boons might seem like blessings, they are always carefully selected by an ukobach and meant to encourage a summoner toward a destructive end. Commonly, such infernal gifts take the form of fireworks and explosives-especially in lands where such creations are uncommon-inscrutable blueprints or formulas for fiendish devices or magic items, or powerfully volatile alchemical reagents.",name:"summoning ukobachs"}],specialattacks:["animate flames","fire breathing","scorch"],speed:["30 ft."],spellsknown:[],sq:"fire leap",sr:{value:15,versus:""},subtype:["devil","evil","extraplanar","lawful"],treasure:"standard",type:"outsider",weaknesses:[],xp:"1200"},umasi:{abilityscores:{cha:8,con:17,dex:15,"int":10,str:18,wis:13},ac:{"flat-footed":16,normal:18,touch:12},alignment:["cn"],auras:[],"class":[],cmb:{bonus:9,special:""},cmd:{bonus:21,special:""},cr:"4",defensiveabilities:[],description:"",dr:[],environment:"tropical jungles",fasthealing:{amount:0,special:""},feats:["great fortitude","improved initiative","multiweapon fighting"],hd:"5d10+15",hp:42,immunities:["disease"],initiative:6,languages:["polyglot"],melee:[{amount:1,bonus:[7],critmin:19,critmult:2,damage:"1d4+4",special:"",weapon:"dagger"},{amount:2,bonus:[7],critmin:20,critmult:2,damage:"1d3+2 nonlethal",special:"",weapon:"unarmed strikes"}],organization:"solitary, hunting party (2-8), or tribe (10-30)",race:"",ranged:[{amount:1,bonus:[7],critmin:20,critmult:3,damage:"1d6",special:"",weapon:"shortbow"}],reach:"5 ft.",regeneration:{amount:0,overcome:""},resistances:[],saves:{fortitude:{bonus:6,circumstantial:[{bonus:2,circumstance:"poison",type:""}]},reflex:{bonus:6,circumstantial:[{bonus:2,circumstance:"poison",type:""}]},will:{bonus:5,circumstantial:[{bonus:2,circumstance:"poison",type:""}]}},senses:["darkvision 60 ft.","perception +12"],size:"medium",skills:{heal:{bonus:13,circumstantial:[]},intimidate:{bonus:6,circumstantial:[]},perception:{bonus:12,circumstantial:[]},stealth:{bonus:11,circumstantial:[]},survival:{bonus:8,circumstantial:[]}},sla:[],space:"5 ft.",specialabilities:[{description:"Umasi can graft the flesh and even limbs of other humanoids to their own bodies in a ritual that takes 1 hour to complete.

Some tales speak of canny travelers who, with the ability to speak Aklo, manage to strike up unlikely conversations with lurking vooniths. In truth, vooniths are quite social, and when one breeches the awkwardness arising from interspecies conf lict, a friendship with a voonith can be an unexpected reward.

Wikkawaks leave no trail in even the heaviest of snows, though salt sprinkled on snow can supposedly reveal a wikkawak's tracks. Of course, by the time one has discovered a wikkawak's trail, it could already be too late. Like most bugbears, wikkawaks normally lead a solitary existence, preying on isolated settlers and hunters like pale arctic serial killers. Their powerful noses can sniff out a humanoid or animal over great distances. The rank smell of fear is a powerful stimulant to wikkawaks, and an individual wikkawak hunter might stalk and terrorize a potential victim for several nights, \"steeping\" its prey in dread and terror before finally pouncing. Wikkawaks consider humanoid flesh a great delicacy, and one might freeze a dead humanoid in a remote area, only to return to its grisly cache again and again to savor the taste of the victim for weeks on end. Wikkawaks enjoy keeping mementos of their victims, and prefer fingers as trophies. Wikkawaks occasionally congregate in larger groups, either to find mates or to better terrorize a large settlement. Wikkawak pairings seldom last longer than a winter, and young wikkawaks are pushed out into the cold to fend for themselves as soon as they've grown their fur. Wikkawaks don't enjoy the company of other goblinoids, and are just as likely to kill and eat a tribe of snow goblins as they are to rule their lesser kin.

Wood giant culture is as complex as their forest homes. Much of a tribe's time is spent tending to a forest's health: planting new trees, clearing away dead brush, and hunting abominations that pervert the natural order. Individuals may even cultivate their forest homes into elaborate demesnes, mazes, or living temples. They are an isolated race, only rarely meeting to trade with other tribes or the occasional elven settlement. While primarily good-natured, wood giants are distrustful of outsiders and prone to great melancholies. Small clans claim enormous tracts of wooded land, but rarely build permanent homes.

Yet even when the last one who maligned it lies dead, its rage remains, turning against all who live, especially the relatives of the target of its original hate. Most zuvembies willingly performed the vile rituals to attain vengeance through unlife, but the transformation can also be wrought upon a helpless victim. The method of transforming into a zuvembie involves the creation and consumption of a vial of oil of animate dead, plus the performance of additional dark rites that take a day to perform and cost 3,000 gp. The ritual kills the target, who must make a DC 20 Will save. Failure results in the victim's death, while success means it reanimates as a free-willed zuvembie.
