      "description": "Spawned from titans who took refuge in the rifts of the Abyss, the Abyss gigas roam the wastes between the oncemighty titan fortresses. These powerful beings do not typically dwell among their own kind, preferring instead to enslave lesser beings-demons and captured planar travelers-and rule over them as despotic tyrants. Many Abyss gigas serve more powerful demon lords in turn. When more than one of the thankfully rare Abyss gigas live near each other, they exist in a state of perpetual warfare, sending forth wave after wave of their minions in battle. In these situations, only rarely do the gigas masters ever face each other and come to blows, and even then never to the death, as they are aware of the fragile existence of their nearly extinct race. When facing other opponents, however, an Abyss gigas is a fearsome foe, battling to the death to prove the superiority of its ancient line. When encountered on the Material Plane, Abyss gigas are fond of taking control of companies of giants and compelling them to do their bidding, feeling at once both a distant kinship and a sense of domineering superiority. Frost giant cults of Kostchtchie are frequent recipients of this sort of attention. Abyss gigas stand over 50 feet tall and weigh 25 tons or more, not including the weight of their Abyss-forged armor and weapons of adamantine. Abyss gigas usually favor the weapons of their demonic patrons. For example, followers of Kostchtchie often wield giant warhammers in both hands, servants of Lamashtu carry falchions, and those serving Urxehl use spiked greatclubs.",

This symbol can be either visible or invisible, as the devil chooses. For as long as the target possesses the mark, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see the false divinity ability). The target also gains the ability to telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance as long as the two creatures are on the same plane. An advodaza can mark multiple creatures, up to an amount equaling its Hit Dice (typically 18). An advodaza can dispel its mark as a standard action, no matter where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, deal pain to a mark bearer that causes 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw.

This armor grants an advodaza a +6 armor bonus to AC and immunity to cold, electricity, and sonic damage, as well as immunity to the spell dismissal. The spells chaos hammer, holy smite, holy word, and word of chaos destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC and immunities (its cold immunity decreases to its normal resistance 10).

These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to renew their power and lordship over mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are eidolons of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, devils of faith, and fiends of blasphemy- the idol-clad advodazas.No two advodazas look exactly alike, each embodying the powers and concerns that saw it worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal, half-bestial shapes bristling with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith, usually in the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons. Despite their range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess unique abilities.

While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters, begging any power that would listen for protection from storms, beasts, enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the land, sky, and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive influences, these forces heard these early prayers and worked what appeared to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly, these formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladiums, and all manner of cult images. Yet, as knowledge of true deities and the powers they offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were forgotten or demonized and rooted out. While most simply faded into the ethers of time, the bitterest demi-deities of countless worlds found their way to Hell and Asmodeus, who welcomed them and offered them a chance for renewed power and worship, as well as a chance to avenge themselves against the deities and mortals who had snubbed them. Honing their hatreds through ages of flame, these beings emerged from the Pit as advodazas.

      "description": "Agyra, the Forever Storm, is believed by many cultures to be the cause of seasonal typhoons or other great storms- such tempests being a manifestation of Agyra's monstrous breaths as she exhales during her long slumber every season. While this kaiju is not in fact responsible for the world's storms, her powers over wind and lightning are significant, and when she is vexed to rampage, the effects of her hurricanes can be as devastating to a region as her more direct attacks. Agyra has the appearance of a primeval, two-headed flying reptile with a wingspan of over 150 feet. Her tail is perhaps the most fearsome of her aspects. This lengthy and flailing appendage is covered with razor-sharp blades and wickedly barbed spines capable of slashing through buildings and tearing through armor with great force and from great distances. Agyra dwells on the upper slopes of a long-dormant volcano that sits on a remote tropical island beyond the main shipping lanes and the scope of most explorers' travels. As with many kaiju, she spends the bulk of her time in deep and peaceful slumber. She is ferociously protective of the strange peoples who dwell on the shores of this island, and has been known to rouse herself to come to their defense against slavers, pirates, or other external threats to their way of life. Despite this strange protective streak, Agyra is not a kindly creature-and none know this more plainly than those who share her island. Her responses to intrusions to the island may simply be defenses of her perceived territories, for certainly the villages of the locals suffer significant damage during her local rampages. She's been known to take wing to travel to distant cities as well, often as a result of some of her island's inhabitants being taken from the shores as slaves. Yet the devastation she wreaks upon the slavers' destination cities pays no regard to the safety of the slaves themselves-they are in as much danger as anyone else from the kaiju's vengeful wrath in this situation. There are rumors that certain shamans on the isle conceal sacred words or some ancient ritual to waken and command Agyra, and that many of her rampages are not the result of the kaiju being territorial or protective, but simply due to an ancient bargain the natives' ancestors forged with the mighty beast in some forgotten era. Some speculate that such rituals require the sacrifice of trespassers, but this may be nothing more than fearful superstition or rumors spread by shamans to persuade foreigners to stay clear of their island. Agyra has a particular hatred of the kaiju Mogaru, and often leaves her volcanic lair to fly west to the remote jungle lake that serves as Mogaru's home to clash with her nemesis. Mogaru's penchant for attacking coastal cities often results in a devastating escalation when Agyra arrives to do battle with the land-bound kaiju. Sometimes, methods of conjuring Agyra are used to deliberately lure the kaiju to a city besieged by Mogaru, but just as often her arrival seems to be driven by self-interest. Agyra typically manages to weaken Mogaru enough to drive him off, but is often slain herself in these battles, resurrecting and returning to her home at the same time Mogaru returns to his. The nature of this rivalry is unclear, but kaiju scholars believe that the two monsters have been enemies for longer than humanity has existed.",

Additionally, an akvan's stomach is thickly armored, allowing it to benefit from its entire natural armor bonus instead of merely half.<br/>Akvans number among the most physically powerful and openly destructive servants of Ahriman, directly carrying out his ancient plans for oblivion. Their twisted minds bend toward desolation, ruin, and blasphemy, and their hatred of the gods of creation and beings renowned for inspiring art and wonder knows few equals. Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their hatred to encompass geniekind as well. Akvans seek out wonders to destroy-monuments from lost ages that have long inspired awe and pride or beings and establishments said to be invincible. While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan's evil does not end with its victim's death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield-or are belched up from an akvan's gullet-as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an army of profane slaves. Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the racial compulsion to which all akvans bow. These divs always go out of their way to hunt, destroy, and consume any genie they encounter. While wise enough to not waste their lives in combat against foes obviously more powerful then they, akvans seek to bring low any such opponents, if not by brute strength, then by guile.

Victims still receive saving throws against these spell effects, but if they fail their saves they are not aware the devil is working its power upon them. A deimavigga can affect multiple victims with different spell effects in the same round.

Their slowly ever-shifting masks speak envenomed words and imply the hollow nature of their lies. Speaking out against all deities-except for Asmodeus, whom they subtly tout as a bringer of discipline even as they downplay his divinity-these deadly intellectuals know that those who turn from their deities are more likely to succumb to the temptations of their diabolical brethren.Rather than attempting to sway the souls of individual mortals, these cunning fiends take on the roles of prophets of reason, disguising themselves beneath layers of illusion to evangelize the virtues and freedoms of lives unshackled from demanding deities. Occasionally one might focus its arguments on a soul of particular piety, delighting in throwing deities' most devoted servants into endless crises of faith. Deimaviggas care little for what gods their depredations affect, disenfranchising the worshipers of the divine and the profane alike.In their natural shapes, deimaviggas stand 7 feet tall and weigh a mere 120 pounds.

They find their arguments benefit from simplicity, their endeavors complicated by even the most obedient minions.

A hibernating aspidochelone is considered to have taken 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a rock or island. An aspidochelone rouses from its hibernation for one of two reasons: hunger or disturbance. After entering its hibernation, a aspidochelone sleeps for 2d10x10 years, rousing naturally after this time has elapsed. An aspidochelone about to awaken usually sleeps fitfully for the last year of its rest, quivering with tremors that feel like earthquakes to creatures upon it. These tremors are treated as a minor version of the earthquake spell that affects the entire island, forcing creatures on the ground to make a DC 29 Reflex save to avoid falling down and causing 30 points of damage to all structures. An aspidochelone might be awakened immediately if it takes 100 or more points of damage in a single day. If awakened in this manner, an aspidochelone typically dives to escape its attacker, then rises again to consume it. The save DC is Constituiton-based.",

Even if a creature escapes the undertow, the water within 100 feet of a passing aspidochelone is treated as rough water, requiring a DC 20 Swim check to move at half speed. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br/>A legendary creature of the sea, aspidochelones are eldritch whales of titanic size. When floating near the surface of the water, aspidochelones have frequently been mistaken by desperate sailors for small islands due to the craggy, mottled flesh of their steeply humped backs.Yet, upon tethering their boats to the whale's tough hide and lighting a fire to ward off the cold, many castaways discover to their horror that the spur of land they have beached upon is in fact an enormous creature. This realization comes too late for many unfortunate souls as the creature plunges beneath the waves, dragging trespassers down with it.An aspidochelone appears to be a huge whale with an extraordinarily thick, rock-like hide. From tail to snout, the creature generally measures more than 500 feet in length, and weighs upward of 100,000 tons. Few ever see an aspidochelone for what it actually is, however, having only glimpsed the pitted and uneven skin of its topside.As seabirds and other creatures come to rest upon the hibernating creature, they carry with them plant seeds and dirt.

Fortunately for seafaring civilizations that rely upon fishing and sea trade for their livelihoods, the gigantic whales are rarely seen.</br>Thought by many to be creatures of myth, the incredibly long-lived aspidochelones spend most of their adult lives in extended periods of hibernation. The creatures possess sluggish metabolisms, allowing them to remain dormant for decades at a time as they slowly consume the fat built up during previous feeding frenzies. As they float near the surface of the water, drifting with the oceanic currents, the whales are frequently mistaken for small islands. Even while hibernating, aspidochelones exude an intoxicating pheromone, causing birds and animals such as sea lions to seek them out. While the huge numbers of creatures rarely cause the beasts to rouse from their slumber, foolhardy human explorers or would-be settlers often startle them out of their reveries when they mistake the creatures' skin for rock or clay.Even when provoked by humans, aspidochelones seldom remain awake unless stirred by their ferocious hunger.When they waken, the whales are wracked by terrible hunger pangs and rampage about the oceans, seeking tons of prey to consume before sinking into their torpor once again. An aspidochelone is a terror during its feeding season, rightfully feared by seagoing civilizations as a monster of the deep come to devour the world. When feeding, the whales consume vast quantities of food, devouring schools of fish, large sea creatures, and sailing vessels alike. Such immense consumption of sea life frequently devastates local ecosystems, wiping out all food sources for dozens of leagues in every direction.",

From these unions only one aspidochelone is ever born, and the whales spend 6 months raising the calf to maturity. Once the calf becomes full-grown, the aspidochelones part ways, never to see one another again.</br>Among island cultures, a number of myths have sprung up around the creatures. Legends speak of how an irresistible smell lures sailors to remote islands, only to have the entire ship and crew devoured by the titanic whales in a single gulp. A few outlandish myths even claim that the creatures have devoured entire islands, while pirate tales tell of fantastic treasure buried within the hides of beasts like island.

      "description": "An astral leviathan is an immense predator that patrols the silvery void of the Astral Plane in search of food and new experiences. Dangerous if provoked, it is intelligent enough to be reasoned with, though most visitors to that plane mistakenly believe it is just a beast. It requires only a minimal amount of physical food, as it primarily sustains itself on planar energies (particularly those radiating from natural portals to other planes) and invisible streamers of astral dust. Astral leviathans are curious about types of creatures they've never met before and places they haven't visited. Civilized inhabitants of the Astral Plane might befriend, bribe, or tame leviathans, using them as cargo vessels or navigators on journeys to remote locations. More savage races enslave them with enchantments and hooked barbs and use them for the same purpose. An astral leviathan is approximately 70 feet long and weighs 60 tons.",

            "description": "As a swift action, an asurendra can call forth up to six longsword-shaped force effects that float near the asurendra until directed. The asurendra can use a standard action to direct one blade to attack a target up to a distance of 50 feet away, or use a full-attack action to cause all six blades to attack up to six different targets up to a distance of 50 feet away, each to a different location if desired. Once an asurendra directs a spirit blade to attack a foe, the blade continues to make a single attack against that foe each round on the asurendra's turn until directed otherwise by the asurendra and as long as the foe remains within 50 feet of the asurendra. As a move action, the asurendra can direct all currently attacking blades to switch targets to new foes within 50 feet. These weapons attack using the asurendra's base attack bonus modified by its Wisdom modifier (+29 for most asurendras), and deal 3d6 points of damage plus an amount of force damage equal to the asurendra's Wisdom modifier (3d6+7 for most asurendras). Physical attacks do no affect these blades, but disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation (touch AC 25) causes them to vanish. If a spirit blade's target dies or moves beyond a 50-foot range and the asurendra does not retarget that blade by the end of its turn, the blade vanishes. Likewise, any blades that are not within 50 feet of the asurendra at the end of its turn also vanish.<br/>With the notable exception of the unique asura ranas, asurendras are the mightiest of their kind. Although few asurendras possess anything resembling an extended realm, in Hell or elsewhere, these asuras are the \"wise ones\" of asura kind. Most dwell within shrinelike fortresses in which they can practice their ruinous mysticism and command lesser asuras who seek their teachings. To most asuras, an asurendra's order is something akin to a deific edict. Each asurendra is a humanoid creature of immense proportions. Their exact appearance varies just as the appearances of humanoids vary, but all asurendras have six arms and multiple eyes and heads. An asurendra's body is an example of physical perfection, athletically and gracefully built, but its face has monstrous or inhuman features, such as tusks or bizarrely placed features. Most asurendras are 19 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds. Few asurendras were born to their might-they achieve their power only over the course of countless lifetimes spent as lesser asuras. Throughout each incarnation, these tenacious asuras sought unity with some concept of destruction. Eventually, through dark meditation and vile action, the asuras ascended to a state of being united with some aspect of unmaking. They also gained power over their own being and slowly reshaped themselves into a vision of their perfect selves, instruments of annihilation ideally suited to fell gods and their divine works. In battle, an asurendra does its best to destroy all enemies, taking a moment to ensure death when any foe falls. Asurendras enjoy eating the bodies of fallen foes, and some can even use the flesh and bone of those they consume to create new asuras to serve them. <br/>",

            "description": "<br> Each asurendra follows its own bliss toward a specific method of vengeance against the divine. Like philosophers dispensing wisdom, they teach their ways to others so that more asuras might ascend into perfection. Listed here are some ideas of the vile ways asurendras might use their \"enlightened\" hatred. Death: All living things can die. Instead of war, an asurendra can focus on the aftermath of war. Such an asurendra replaces quickened baleful polymorph with quickened slay living and quickened blade barrier with quickened circle of death. Its spirit blades deal negative energy damage, not force damage, and can thus be used to heal allied undead creatures as easily as they can serve as weapons against the living. Sacrilege: Blasphemy is joy to any asura, but truly impious asurendras learn talents that mimic divine miracles. Cults to these asurendras, which almost always seem benevolent on first glance, turn people from the worship of real deities. These asurendras do not possess a spirit blade special attack, but can use miracle as a spell-like ability once per day as long as the miracle granted is in keeping with their blasphemous design. Shaping: Some asurendras like to remake what the gods have created. Nothing escapes a shaper's vision, and its enemies find their bodies, minds, and souls are like clay in a shaper's hands. An asurendra sage of shaping lacks a spirit blade special attack, but gains the following special ability. Create Asura (Su): As a full-round action, an asurendra can turn a creature that it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a tripurasura (see page 26) that it then excretes into existence. Such tripurasuras remain loyal to the asurendra that created them as long as they remain tripurasuras. If an asurendra has enough tripurasuras at hand, it can consume them as well and transform them into more powerful asuras using this ability. An asurendra can transform any tripurasuras it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a number of Hit Dice worth of other asuras equal to the number of tripurasuras it has consumed. An asurendra can create as many tripurasuras as it wishes with this ability, but can only create more powerful asuras by combining multiple tripurasuras once per day. An asurendra cannot create another asurendra with this ability. A newly formed asura considers the asurendra to be its master. Not all of a creature's soul is consumed when it is used to create a tripurasura-beings swallowed and used to create asuras in this manner are dead, but can be restored to life as normal.</br>",

The demon these folk fear is the balor, and that fear is justly placed, for few demons can match the mighty balor in strength or brutality.On the Abyss, most balors serve demon lords as generals or captains (those balors who don't are even more potent, and are known as balor lords-see below). A balor typically commands vast legions of demons, and while it often lets these slavering and eager minions fight its battles, the balor is far from a coward. If presented with an opportunity to join a fight, few balors choose to resist.In combat, a balor relies upon its spell-like abilities to fight foes wise enough to avoid melee range, favoring destructive powers like fire storm or implosion and saving dominate monster for use against the rare foe it would prefer to capture alive. A balor usually uses telekinesis to disarm ranged weapons or pull foes into melee-with the use of a quickened telekinesis, a balor can use the latter tactic and still inf lict a full-round attack on a hapless foe.A balor reduced to fewer than 50 hit points almost always seeks to flee via teleportation, but if that and flight prove impossible it seeks to position itself such that, if it is slain, its death throes are as devastating as possible to the enemy host.A balor stands 14 feet in height and weighs 4,500 pounds.Only the cruelest mortal souls can fuel the creation of a balor-unlike in the cases of most other demons, it often takes multiple souls of powerful villains to trigger the birthing of a new balor.",

The majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger (although ranger balor lords never form bonds with animals), but some instead have levels of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard. Cleric balor lords are unknown, as they see themselves as objects of worship, not the other way around, although rumors persist of powerful balor clerics that directly serve demon lords or even evil gods.In addition to any benefits a balor lord might gain from its class levels, all balor lords possess one additional unique ability over and above those granted by its race and class.

A balor lord typically rules over a region no larger than half the size of the realm in which it resides (as only full demon lords can command the rule of an entire Abyssal realm), and even though most balor lords rule much smaller regions (generally areas comparable in size to a single continent), their power is vast indeed.A balor lord is typically a CR 21 to CR 25 monster (a range shared with the various unique nascent demon lords, with the range of CR 26 and above being the domain of the demon lords themselves), and as such serves quite well as the final villain in a long-running campaign. The majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger (although ranger balor lords never form bonds with animals), but some instead have levels of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard.

It gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track creatures it has wounded.<br/>Bandersnatches are consummate hunters, and only the deadliest predators or the most cunning intelligent prey offer them sport. Once a bandersnatch has marked a creature for death, it runs it to ground without fear, rest, or remorse. Bandersnatches rely on speed, shock, and terror to bring down prey. They pace their quarry from a distance, hidden among the trees, then break from cover, savage their target, and dart away again. They drag smaller creatures away to dispatch at leisure, while engaging larger ones in skirmishes until they gradually wear their prey down. An outmatched bandersnatch withdraws at full speed, from their allies. Once its wounds heal, the bandersnatch returns to the scene of its defeat, picks up the trail of its assailants, and eliminates them one by one. In appearance, a bandersnatch resembles a tawny, six-legged great cat, but with wickedly barbed quills running the length of its body and down to the tip of its long, flexible tail. Its quills serve to deter attackers, but also act as a formidable weapon. With a single flick of its muscular tail, a bandersnatch can fling as many as a half-dozen quills at distant foes with surprising accuracy. A bandersnatch captivates any prey that meets the gaze of its saucerlike, luminous eyes. A bandersnatch measures 40 feet in length plus another 10 feet of tail and weighs 12,000 pounds. Despite their bulk, bandersnatches move with speed, grace, and even considerable stealth when required. Bandersnatches were once native to the primal world of the fey, where they preyed on the greatest hunters of that ancient realm. As with other legendary creatures from this realm, such as the jabberwock, bandersnatches belong to a group of creatures known collectively as the \"Tane.\" Whether the fey were careless in guarding their portals or released the first bandersnatches into Material Plane deliberately cannot be said with certainty. Rare in the extreme on the Material Plane, bandersnatches lair within forgotten forests where ancient beasts walk the world. Bandersnatches mate only rarely. A female becomes fertile perhaps once or twice per century, leaving the male soon after mating and giving birth to only one or two kittens per litter. The mother brings meat to her ravenous young, which mature into lesser bandersnatches (see below) within a year. Bandersnatches live for a thousand years or longer. <br/>",

After spending 1 minute in any maze, he understands its entire layout implicitly and can teleport to any location using his greater teleport spell-like ability.<br>Baphomet-Lord of the Minotaurs-was created by Lamashtu from the soul of the first minotaur. In those days, he was a powerfully muscled specimen, and the Queen of Demons kept him as a consort until the day Baphomet stole away from her palace in Yanaron, seeking to gain even greater favor by claiming a legendary trophy. Baphomet's ambition was as great as his folly, and he invaded the deepest layer of Hell, intent on stealing Asmodeus's ruby rod for his mistress. Needless to say, he was swiftly caught. Lamashtu claimed no allegiance to him, and Asmodeus imprisoned Baphomet in a devious maze the archdevil proclaimed to be unsolvable, even by the first minotaur. The archdevil also carved his own symbol into Baphomet's brow with the nail of his index finger in an attempt to fully subjugate the minotaur. But in this attempt, it was Asmodeus who overstepped his bounds. Not only did Baphomet solve the seemingly unsolvable maze after a mere decade, but as he escaped, he also took the world-sized labyrinth with him. Baphomet had changed over that time, becoming almost emaciated in his build, yet growing much wiser. He did not return to Lamashtu's side, but instead took the archdevil's infernal maze and made it his own as he claimed a portion of the Abyss as his realm. This was eons ago, and now Baphomet is a powerful demon lord in his own right. He has forgiven Lamashtu, and serves as her lover now and then, yet he's no longer her direct subservient minion. He works to increase the inf luence of his cult on countless worlds, building his forces so that one day he might again invade Hell. But this time, Baphomet plans on taking much more than Asmodeus's weapon-he intends to take Asmodeus's life! <br/></br>",

His humanoid worshipers venerate him in secret, offering prayers and sacrifices in hidden shrines and dark temples beyond the sight of society and communicating in a complex series of hand gestures when in mixed company. Baphomet has two symbols. To most, including his minotaurs, his symbol is a brass minotaur's head with ruby eyes. His secret societies use this symbol as well, but also mark his works with the inverted pentagram, sometimes decorating the star shape with an image of his face. Baphomet's favored weapon is the glaive, although he does not abide any of his followers wielding a weapon that looks like Aizerghaul.

      "description": "Bezravnis, known also as the Inferno Below, dwells in the sands of a sparsely inhabited high-altitude desert found in the shadow of the world's largest mountain range. There, the 130-foot-long beast slumbers the centuries away until its cycle of wakefulness rouses it from its torpor and causes it to emerge from the sands in an eruption of fire and ash. The Inferno Below then begins its rampage, traveling in a straight line toward a heavily populated region bordering the great desert. Typically, the Inferno Below's rampage is limited to a single city, and never the same one twice in a row. After destroying no less than two-thirds of the city, it retreats back to the vast desert, burrows deep, and settles into a new sleep of ages. The reason for the Inferno Below's cyclic rampages is not well understood, but the cycle of these rampages functions like clockwork-they take place every 273 years with little deviation. As there seems to be no pattern to the kaiju's attacks themselves, with a different city being targeted each cycle, the cities of the bordering nations do their best to prepare for the monster's attack. The nations themselves have little love for each other, and attempts to generate lures to direct the kaiju's march toward an enemy city are common-yet these lures have yet to work, and in fact they seem to result in the kaiju attacking a city in the luring nation more often than not. Other cities spare no expense during a so-called \"Inferno Season,\" and send huge armies of scouts into the desert to watch for signs of the kaiju's emergence or traces of its burrowing passage through the sands, in hopes of determining the direction of the beast's travel and warning likely target cities (or, in the case of a trajectory that leads it to an enemy city, working to silence warnings). Kaiju scholars have correlated Bezravnis's appearance with the passage of a singular red comet in the skies above the world-an astronomical event known as the Inferno Star. As the comet nears the world, Bezravnis emerges, and as the comet vanishes from the sky, the kaiju turns its back and returns to the desert. Confirmation of this correlation has given rise to numerous theories. Some believe that Bezravnis first fell to the world from the Inferno Star, and its advent wakens within the beast a bewildered longing for home that drives it into a frenzy. Others hold that the kaiju exists as a guardian against an even more deadly occupant of the Inferno Star, and that by displaying its power by destroying a city, Bezravnis is in fact protecting the world by driving the Inferno Star back into the depths of space. But Bezravnis doesn't always have the luxury of waiting for the Inferno Star to draw near before waking. At several points in the past, lunatics, cults, and accidents have woken the kaiju before its appointed time. Some mad, apocalyptic-minded spellcasters use powerful magic to cause great explosions above the sands where the kaiju slumbers. Earthquakes, severe weather phenomena, and similar natural events have been known to waken the monster early as well. When Bezravnis wakens off-cycle like this, the monster is particularly foul-tempered. It's rampage does not follow a straight line-instead, its travels are erratic as it pursues the perceived cause of its wakening with single-minded ferocity and tenacity. In this way, cults have accomplished what the border nations have not-leading the kaiju to attack an enemy. Of course, such tactics are dangerous and often backfire, for Bezravnis is fast and destructive, and it has been known to follow such tormenters. Bezravnis doesn't seem to be particularly vexed by the presence of other kaiju, and ignores them unless it is attacked first. Once attacked, however, the Inferno Below becomes singularly focused and deviates from its path to fight the target creature as long as it remains visible or alive. Smaller foes can sometimes distract the kaiju from its path in this manner if they can deal enough damage upon the creature to bait it into directing its furious rage on them.",

The coloration of these creature ranges widely, from dark blues and purples to pale grays, yellows, or white. A bhole's cavernous mouth consists of long, bony jaws that extend and unfold from the creature's head when it feeds. Bholes are incredibly long-lived- those that exist in remote worlds or in other dimensions have done so for countless eons. The bholes themselves seem to have no interest in their history, perhaps as a result of their limited intellect, but they can live forever, barring death by violence. Regions inhabited by bholes are always wastelands. Bholes seem able to eat and digest anything and everything, and in time can reduce a huge area to just a honeycombed network of immense tunnels. These regions swiftly collapse in on themselves, leaving rubble-filled pits of terrifying size.",

After the creature has finished gestating, it is regurgitated from the hindquarters of the Blood Queen, encased in an opaque mucous pod. Any attempt to remove a gestated humanoid from its pod causes massive system shock, and the humanoid takes 6d6 points of damage unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save or those releasing it succeed at a DC 25 Heal check. As a swift action, the Blood Queen can send strong telepathic emanations to any pod within 100 feet, causing it to violently explode. The resulting spray of bilious ooze deals 6d6 points of acid damage to the creature encased in the pod and to any creatures in a 15-foot-radius burst. Alternatively, the Blood Queen may allow an encased humanoid to continue to gestate for at least 24 hours, and after that duration may release the fully metamorphosed creature from its pod at any point. When released, the victim completes its transformation into a kuru surrogate (see the Kuru Surrogate section below). The Blood Queen may create any number of pods, but can only possess up to six kuru surrogates at any one time (if the Blood Queen releases a seventh kuru surrogate from its mucus pod, the oldest surrogate immediately dies no matter where it is and the Blood Queen is dazed for 1 round). The save DCs are Constitution-based.<br/>Millennia ago, when the repugnant cyclops empire of Ghol-Gan populated the Shackles, its foul and alien gods sent powerful servants from beyond to act as their intermediaries, guiding and corrupting the empire until its ignominious collapse, at which point the gods and their minions fled Golarion altogether. However, one of these vile servants remained even after Ghol-Gan's collapse, a wretched horror known as the Blood Queen. It has dwelt for centuries in its foul subterranean chamber in a ruined Ghol-Gan temple called Ganagsau in the Cannibal Isles, and it was this blasphemous being who transformed the kuru into the degenerate race they are today, convincing them that it is a living goddess worthy of their veneration. The Blood Queen has a kuru high priest who goes by the name Bukrugsor, and this devoted thrall sees to it that his dark patron is brought regular sacrificial victims and offerings of blood. The Blood Queen has no eyes, per se-rather, what look like angry pustules all over its bloated body act as sensory organs. In addition, it is able to see and hear the world through the various kuru surrogates its followers have interspersed throughout the Cannibal Isles. Its grotesque mouth is capable of articulating a number of languages, though if it deigns to speak with a creature it usually does so via its telepathy. While the Blood Queen uses the short tentacles that extend from its mouth to devour prey and sacrificial offerings, the tentacles that emanate from its hindquarters are long, muscular, and tipped with bonelike stingers that allow it to manipulate objects and electrify victims. The Blood Queen is nearly immobile, being a massive, swollen beast that sits in the middle of a huge underground temple chamber in its ruined cathedral. While it may slowly undulate its bulk in one direction or another, in the years since its appearance on Golarion, the Blood Queen has grown far too large to fit through any of the limestone chamber's exits. Only the Blood Queen's high priest, those destined to become surrogate kuru, or sacrifices to the behemoth monster are allowed within this foul throne room. Sometimes unwilling sacrifices are dropped into the chamber from a hole in the ceiling and the exits are sealed so that the Blood Queen may toy with its food before it feeds. A being of monumental evil, the Blood Queen expresses its rage at its divine abandonment by spreading as much pain and havoc as it can. Whether it ever escapes its ancient, self-made prison remains to be seen, though all right-thinking creatures that know of its existence shudder at the prospect. <br/>",

If the victim fails its save against the nightmare, the horrific dream unfolds as a vision of Bokrug consuming the victim alive.

Yet the still, ominous waters are neither stale nor brackish, implying that they connect somewhere deep underground, and.

Bokrug's temples are often found on the shores of remote lakes or hidden away in large swamplands. Though humans worship him, so do boggards, lizardfolk, marsh giants, and other swamp-dwelling races-particularly those who have suffered at the hands of aggressors, such as invading armies, rival tribes, or adventuring parties. Though Bokrug is chaotic neutral, almost all of his worshipers are chaotic neutral or chaotic evil. Only a rare few chaotic good worshipers of Bokrug exist- most of these being delusional heretics or apologists who seek to keep Bokrug calm, ensuring he continues to slumber. These heretics and outliers of the faith are remorselessly hunted down by his more zealous and traditional worshipers. Bokrug's cult is associated with revenge, storms, and water, and its sacred symbol is a green lizard with a long, coiling tail-an image of Bokrug himself. His greatest shrines feature unusually realistic statues of his form, statues the cult maintains Bokrug can see out of and even animate from his distant lair to take sacrifices. Bokrug's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Water, and Weather, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Oceans, Rage, and Storms. The Water Lizard's favored weapon is the ranseur; his followers often forge their ranseurs' blades to resemble the Great Old One's stingered tail.</br>",

      "description": "Brijidines are passionate, powerful azatas attuned to the powers of earth and fire. They love basking in volcanoes, writing poetry, tending to sick creatures, and pursuing spicy recipes. The quickest way to befriend a brijidine is to present her with a fireproof copy of an exotic poem or a bag of rare peppers. Though their power is tied to primal destruction, they are quick-witted and love clever wordplay, whether in a sonnet or a dirty limerick. The brijidine sees fire as a form of purity, a marked difference from its classical association with devastation and destruction. To a brijidine, the existence of hellfire is the rankest blasphemy, and while many azatas look to the demons of the Abyss as their greatest enemies, it is among the devils of Hell that most brijidines find focus for their anger. The fact that devils are immune to fire, the brijidine's greatest strength, frustrates and angers these azatas all the more, forcing them to become far more imaginative and creative in their tactics when facing such foes. A brijidine stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",

Far more often, though, bythos seek out abuses of planar travel, such as tears in reality, regions where planes overlap, or creatures that abuse the use of planar travel. In some cases, such distortions are ignored, but in others, a bythos or even a full tribunal comes to assess and repair the damage. In most cases, \"repair\" is analogous to the death of the creature responsible for the distortions, but placing such creatures in temporal stasis can also solve the problem.

      "description": "Cairn linnorms prefer to dwell in necropolises, amid reaches of burial mounds, or in caverns below the scorched earth of legendary battlefields. These linnorms particularly relish the flavor of undead flesh-while they cannot consume incorporeal undead, regions they haunt are typically barren of corporeal undead not canny enough to avoid the cairn linnorm's ravenous appetite. An incredibly powerful undead creature might use a cairn linnorm as a guardian, manipulating the dragon while it selects a cairn or tomb well within the linnorm's territory. While cairn linnorms will not hesitate to feed on undead creatures they encounter, some ancient superstition shared by all of their kind prevents them from actually entering a tomb or other enclosed burial site unless granted permission by the tomb's undead denizens or a priest devoted to the religion associated with the site. Likewise, a cairn linnorm somehow caught within a tomb large enough to contain it prefers not to leave without securing similar permission to do so. These limitations are purely psychological, and if pressed (such as by an enemy seeking to use a tomb entrance as a defense), a cairn linnorm can break such restrictions. A cairn linnorm is 60 feet long and weighs 12,000 pounds.",

He may allow these effects to affect him.<br>Cernunnos is a powerful empyreal lord who embodies the primeval force of nature as well as its wildness. He surrounds himself with counselors and advisors from all of the celestial races. Although he rarely makes a rash decision, he occasionally lets anger overwhelm his better judgment, even going so far as to swear personal vendettas against specific demon lords or archdevils. A peerless archer and hunter, in such moments of vengeance Cernunnos is tempted to visit Hell or the Abyss to personally exact his revenge. His preference for decisive action against enemies puts Cernunnos at odds with Korada. Though Cernunnos agrees that even the wickedest souls can seek redemption, he worries that lives would be lost in the time it would take to allow a fiend to seek enlightenment. The Horned Lord appears as a tall and muscular humanoid with elven features, tan skin, and a pair of antlers growing from his brow. Cernunnos dresses in simple clothes and leathers, died in natural colors but typically woven or worked with motifs of birds in flight or leaping animals. On Elysium, Cernunnos dwells in an expansive palace constructed of interwoven trees and capped with lush foliage. Known as Briarbough, this sprawling complex of gardens and pools is his seat of power and a place of healing where celestials and good mortals come to have their most grievous wounds tended. Beyond lies hundreds of miles of pristine forest and plains; animals killed here are reborn the next day, fully healed. In times of war, Briarbough serves as a headquarters and hospital for good outsiders. When not in Elysium, Cernunnos works with other celestial races to stem the spread of evil throughout the cosmos. Recognizing that-despite his power-he is still only one person, the Horned Lord uses his abilities to strengthen and bolster those already allied against darkness, training marshals and emissaries to work as his agents in the mortal and fey worlds. He favors druids and rangers-archers in particular-among his devotees. In combat, Cernunnos uses stealth and range to draw enemies to terrain of his choosing. The Empyreal Lord then uses his magic to further shape the battlefield to hamper his foes before closing for melee.<br/></br>",

Cernunnos's holy symbol is the head of a stag, ram or similar horned creature with torcs or rings hanging from its horns. His favored weapon is the longbow.

      "description": "Some dead don't rest easy because of the circumstances of their death or the horrific experiences they underwent in life. Their souls return to the world of the living demanding justice, revenge, or just wanton destruction. Some dead, however, never intended for their souls to leave. Instead they wished to preserve their knowledge, their culture, or some other aspect of their life in an undying form that could forever accumulate more of the same. In these instances, where lichdom is not sought as a viable option, and a multitude of individuals wish to take part, the result can be a charnel colossus. A charnel colossus is an amalgam of scores, even hundreds, of individuals who, upon death, chose to be interred under special ritual circumstances with others of like mind. This allowed them to feed their individual life experiences into an undying corporation of the collective whole. The resulting monstrosity would be like a living library-if it were living. The individual will of the deceased participants is subsumed in favor of a hive-like personality composed of all of the knowledge and experiences of the individual contributors. A few dominant or powerful members of this amalgam may give the resulting combined creature a general style of behavior, but no single constituent provides the creature with a true guiding force. Instead, the result is a pooling of the wisdom and experience of those who have been so interred-often over a period spanning hundreds of years-creating an abomination whose sole focus is the perpetuation of any such cultural traditions and the acquisition of more constituent parts to ever expand its breadth of experience. It is this guiding gluttony for further expansion of consciousness that ensures that even the most benign of traditions or experiential pools from which a charnel colossus is formed inevitably results in an all-consuming horror. The charnel colossus is a mass of the corpses that form its composition, often intermixed with earth, broken grave goods, and other burial materials if the decayed bodies alone are insufficient to fill out its massive size. This amorphous whole is collected within a membrane through which the individual corpses can still be seen and against which they often press as if seeking their freedom. But when a creature becomes trapped in the embrace of a colossus, the membrane proves to be permeable-the rotten, lipless mouths of those so interred are able to reach forth and feed upon the victim's own life experience. The colossus can also form two thin tendrils of this charnel stuff in order to lash out and draw prey into its embrace. As powerful, ever-hungering abominations, charnel colossi are thankfully few and far between. The only documented one currently known to exist is reported to be trapped beneath the ruins of Kalexcourt in northwestern Ustalav, in an ancient Kellid shamanistic burial site.",

As a result, the charnel colossus can use up to two spell-like abilities in the same round that it makes physical attacks or other full-found actions. It also gains an additional spell attack per round. In addition, a charnel colossus is immune to being turned (though it can still take damage from channeled positive energy).

On a failed save, the cadavers that make up the charnel colossus lock their mouths against the victim and begin to draw forth a part of her sentience to add to the collective. This action deals 1d6 points of Wisdom damage per round. If the victim's Wisdom score is reduced to 0, her soul and persona are wholly subsumed by the charnel colossus, and her body becomes bleached white and brittle and is incorporated into the creature's mass. The charnel colossus then has full access to all of the victim's memories (though not any special powers), and the victim can only be recovered and returned to life with a wish or miracle.

Regardless of whether or not the save is successful, the effect leaves an insidious seed implanted in the victim's mind. The day after the save is made, the victim must succeed at a new save or the seed takes root and creates the subconscious compulsion for the victim to return to the charnel colossus at some point in the future. When and how this occurs is up the GM. This compulsion can be removed with a remove curse spell or by destroying the charnel colossus that implanted the compulsion. This is a mind-affecting compulsion and cannot be negated by a silence spell because it is heard directly in the mind of the victim. Each time a creature is subjected to this attack, there is a 1% chance that some of the lost lore transmitted into her mind causes her to gain a permanent +2 bonus to Intelligence. This beneficial side effect can only occur to a creature once. When a charnel colossus uses this ability, it cannot use its spell-like abilities or take other actions in that round.

In these eldritch works of art, he is depicted or described as having a vaguely humanoid frame, but with immense draconic wings and an octopus-shaped head. His actual form is somewhat fluid-the Great Old One can shift and reshape his exact countenance as he wills, allowing him to occupy a smaller space than one might expect for a creature that stands over 100 feet tall. It is fortunate indeed that Cthulhu is currently imprisoned on a distant planet within the sunken city of R'lyeh. There, the Great Old One slumbers away the eons in a state neither quite dead nor living, held in stasis by ancient magic and the potency of the Elder Sign, yet at times the city rises from the sea and the doors to his tomb open, granting Cthulhu limited mobility before he must return to his tomb. <br/></br>",

Cthulhu is worshiped by various aquatic races and folk who dwell along coasts, but also among certain decadent or fringe societies of artists, poets, and philosophers. When they form, his cults are secretive and careful to hide their allegiance to the Great Old One, meeting only in desolate and otherwise abandoned locales hidden from society's notice.

Darkvision does not allow someone to see through the ink or smoke, but true seeing does. The ink or smoke persists for 1d4 rounds, but dissipates in 1 round in areas with aquatic currents or winds. Any creature in the breath weapon's area is exposed to the breath weapon's poison (see below) and must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or gain 2 negative levels as its memories and knowledge leach away (this is a mind-affecting effect).

This functions like mass suggestion, but can affect mindless creatures. Dagon can suggest obviously harmful or suicidal acts (though non-mindless creatures gain a +10 bonus on their saving throws against these suggestions). The commanded course of activity can have a duration of up to 1 hour. If Dagon issues a new command to a creature, the previous command is discarded.

At the start of the swallowed creature's turn, it must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be nauseated, and must succeed at a DC 36 Will save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity and Charisma drain. Once the creature's Dexterity and Charisma are drained to 0, the creature transforms into a horrifically deformed version of itself that Dagon can then disgorge into any adjacent square as a swift action. The transformed creature gains the half-fiend template, its Dexterity and Charisma return to their normal values, and it is under Dagon's control (as dominate monster, caster level 28th). The transformation can be reversed by casting break enchantment and atonement on the victim during the first 24 hours (after that, it can be reversed only via miracle or wish). The Fortitude save DC is Constitution-based, and the Will save DC is Charisma-based.<br>Dagon is the demon lord of deformity, the sea, and sea monsters. He rules an Abyssal realm that consists of an immense ocean dotted above with strange and horrible islands and marked below with countless deep sea trenches and sunken cities. Dagon is 35 feet long, with the lower body of an eel, a horrif ic visage that evokes images of deep sea predators, and four long tentacles in place of arms. Dagon almost always uses Power Attack in combat, taking a -9 penalty on all attack rolls but gaining a +18 bonus on damage rolls. He is never encountered without a large number of aquatic demons or monsters at his side that he uses as pawns in battles, often simply commanding them to attack foes while he hangs back in the shadows and observes the fight with his cold eyes. Immense sharks, hezrous, carnivorous whales, krakens, and shoggoths are the demon lord's favored minions. Dagon began life not as a demon lord but as a powerful qlippoth-the reasons for his transformation into a demon lord are not understood by mortal scholars, but there is certainly no love lost between Dagon and the qlippoth race. </br>",

His holy places are often decaying seaside churches, lighthouses, sea caves, or darkly beautiful underwater cathedrals. Often his worshipers also venerate various Great Old Ones, in particular Cthulhu, and it's not unusual to find priests of Dagon and Cthulhu working side by side in a community. Dagon is also known as the Shadow in the Sea. His unholy symbol is a gold disk inscribed with sinister runes around an open octopus eye. His favored weapon is the trident.

Being inside the hut is not necessarily dangerous, unless one of Baba Yaga's guardians is there or Baby Yaga herself is home. A swallowed creature can attempt to escape by breaking open the front door, a deceptively sturdy barrier with hardness 15 and 100 hit points that also benefits from the hut's fast healing ability. The hut can expel swallowed creatures as a full-round action, flinging them from its open door. It must make a combat maneuver check against creatures that don't wish to leave, with failure meaning the target is able to hold on to the pitching and warping interior.

A deep sea serpent is rarely seen unless it wishes to be seen, and the beast usually has its own mysterious reasons for occasionally coming to the surface. At other times, those reasons are gruesomely obvious-the deep sea serpent rises to the surface to crush ships and devour sailors who tumble from the freshly shattered hulls. It is thought that in incredibly remote parts of the underwater world, even more powerful deep sea serpents exist, beasts with supernatural luminous lures that can be used to blind foes, or with the ability to create overwhelming blasts of electricity that stun or even outright slay prey with a single stroke. Yet perhaps the most unnerving are the rumors of deep sea serpents that possess a remarkable intelligence. Such creatures, if they even exist, are rarely if ever seen near the surface-both their naturally elusive natures and the remote reality of their habitats mean that ensuring the veracity of these claims requires truly extraordinary efforts. A typical deep sea serpent measures 50 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds.",

The target must be within 60 feet of Shax for him to use this ability. The target can resist this ability with a successful DC 36 Fortitude save. If the target fails the save, Shax can command the victim's blood to behave in one of the manners listed below. Once commanded, the blood continues to function in this way for as long as the victim continues to bleed. Shax can change the effect in a subsequent round by using this ability again, but no more than one of the following effects can be in effect at any one time. The save DC is Charisma-based. Blinding Blood: The victim's blood runs up into its eyes and blinds it at the start of its turn unless the victim takes a move action to wipe away the blood. Once a victim is blinded in this way, it remains blinded as long as the bleed effect continues. Bloody Mess: The victim's blood spreads out across its body, making it slippery. This grants a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and all attempts to resist being grappled, but the victim must succeed at a DC 36 Reflex save at the start of each round or drop objects it holds. These effects last as long as the bleed effect continues. Choking Blood: The target's blood runs up into its nostrils and mouth unless the creature uses a free hand to pinch its nose shut and holds its breath. If the target doesn't do so, the blood runs into its lungs and the creature must succeed at a Constitution check each round or it begins to drown. Once a victim begins to drown, it continues to do so as long as the bleed effect persists. Gruesome Tendrils: This effect automatically ends any bleed effects the victim is currently suffering as it causes the blood coating the victim to solidify into thin, whiplike tendrils that lash out at any creature within 5 feet. Any creature that begins its turn in this area automatically takes 1d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of bleed damage; a successful DC 36 Reflex save prevents this damage.",

He rules an Abyssal realm known as Charnelhome, an immense mansion the size of a city perched atop a slanted bluff surrounded by a bog of thorny, blood-drinking plants. He is fond of inviting his captured enemies as well as his greatest worshipers into the chambers of this building, for those who survive his deathtraps often serve as lessons as to how he can improve his methods of mayhem. Shax is particularly skilled at blinding foes with critical hits-when he does so, he likes to pluck the eyes from his victim's face as part of the attack and swiftly gobble them down whole. He can hurl the countless surgical tools he carries on his body as deadly weapons, but prefers to slaughter foes in melee. <br/></br>",

The cult's holy places are narrow alleyways in violent parts of large cities, hidden rooms in grand estates, and secret dungeons filled with deathtraps and torture chambers. These unholy temples are often guarded by fiendish animals (particularly large, predatory birds) and shadow demons, but are usually watched over by a number of babau demons as well. Enhanced versions of these demons, called the Sons of Shax, and can be found serving his greatest cults (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Demons Revisited 7). Shax's unholy symbol is a curved white feather sitting in a pool of blood. His favored weapon is the dagger. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Nobility, and to the subdomains of Demon, Leadership, Martyr, and Rage.

Deskari carved his realm from the raw matter of the Abyss using a great scythe called Riftcarver (see page 63), a weapon he crafted from the remains of the strange creature his father, Pazuzu, mated with tens of thousands of years ago.

Draconals have a domain spell slot at each spell level but do not gain the granted powers of their chosen domains, nor do they gain access to other cleric abilities.<br>Draconals are mighty agathion lords, few in number and greatly removed from mortal affairs. They watch over powerful magic and are direct agents of the gods and the needs of the good planes. Patient and ageless, they plan for the long term, which often frustrates mortal creatures who seek to gain their assistance with a threat in the here and now. A draconal would rather support or enhance a group of heroes than tackle a problem directly, maintaining its focus on planar matters. Draconals are attuned to nature and believe in cycles of life and death. Though they are good, they understand that the presence of evil gives good creatures something to strive against, preventing stagnation and complacency.

These colors are normally chromatic rather than metallic, and an ignorant person seeing a draconal's colors may mistake her for an evil half-dragon. However, some draconals have metallic or gem-like coloration; for example, a yellow draconal may appear mustard yellow or metallic gold, while a white draconal may be chalk white, pearlescent white, or metallic silver. Draconals can change their coloration after a lengthy period of meditation, but normally only do this in response to some horrible evil that requires their direct intervention. This change affects the draconals' personality, and may alter their physical shape or apparent gender. Black: Black is a balance between male and female energy, and represents the sky, stars, immortality, and leadership. Black draconals are immune to fire damage, and their breath weapon is fire. A black draconal adds Fire, Glory, and Luck to its list of possible domains. Green: Green is slightly skewed toward masculinity. It represents wood, plants, and flowers. Green draconals are immune to cold damage, and their breath weapon is cold. A green draconal adds Animal, Plant, and Water to its list of possible domains. Red: Red is a strongly masculine color, and most red draconals are male or have aggressive or gregarious personalities. Red represents fire, light, and warding against bad luck. Red draconals are immune to fire damage, and their breath weapon is fire. A red draconal adds Fire, Protection, and Sun to its list of possible domains. White: White is slightly skewed toward femininity, and most white draconals are female or have protective or serene personalities. White represents brightness, fulfillment, metal, mourning, and purity. White draconals are immune to cold damage, and their breath weapon is cold. A white draconal adds Artifice, Liberation, and Repose to its list of possible domains. Yellow: Like black, yellow is a balance between male and female energy. Yellow represents earth, oracles, stone, and luck. Yellow draconals are immune to acid, and their breath weapon is acid.

Eternally vigilant and opportunistic, ephialtes kytons hunt for further victims for young kytons to practice upon.Because of their honed expertise in capturing and tormenting souls, ephialtes are highly useful to the diabolical elite-both mortals and the immortal lords of Hell-who seek out ephialtes kytons as fell servants.

At the end of any round it remains paralyzed in this way, the victim must make a DC 31 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain from encroaching madness. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.<br/>Eremites are among the eldest and most mutilated of kytons, having inflicted such massive damage to themselves that they feel little pain and no fear. The typical eremite is completely covered in blood-caked bandages, tattered cords of black leather, and thousands of jagged shards of razor-sharp metal. These fragments are all that holds the creature's mutilated flesh together, yet they do so with a strength far greater than that granted by mortal flesh and bone. Rather than concentrating solely on physical or even spiritual alterations, eremites seek to blur the very lines around being, physicality, and individuality. They desire only the most powerful beings to augment themselves with, traveling across vast swaths of the Material Plane in search of the most promising additions to their bodily collection and harvesting only the finest parts-the ripest spleen, the most alluring veins, the most succulent eyes. When an eremite encounters a creature that possess a so-called \"perfect part,\" the powerful kyton seeks to capture that creature alive so that it can study how that perfect part functions as part of the creature's physiology before it finally decides to surgically remove it and attach it to its own body-often in a way not quite in keeping with the part's original use. A gifted bard's tongue might, for example, be nailed to a kyton's palm or sewn into its heart, while the eyes of a beautiful queen might be stitched into the kyton's torso. To the eremite, these hideous changes and choices somehow enhance the perfection of the harvested part, while to others they merely enhance the horror that the creature represents. While eremites do hold an appreciation for inspection of their targets as well as introspection regarding their own powers and identity, their primary occupation is the understanding of pain and suffering, which they pursue by inflicting the most heinous cruelties upon their victims. An eremite seeks to deliver as much agony as possible to its victims after capturing them, allowing them to undergo extreme amounts of trauma before letting them perish. An eremite often rends its own flesh in the same manner as it does its victim's, so as to experience the pain alongside it. While pursuing a chosen victim, an eremite utilizes its supernatural abilities to distract and distress a given target before it captures and drags it back to the Plane of Shadow via plane shift. Bargaining with an eremite is not usually an option, though if a particularly powerful victim can offer an eremite advice or aid, or otherwise assist in harvesting an even more interesting catch, an eremite can sometimes be convinced to let the helpful victim escape. It's worth remembering, though, that kytons as a whole have little patience for the petty pursuits of honor and pride, seeing such feelings as traits that ultimately spell the end for baser creatures. The only thing that matters to an eremite is the testing of its boundaries as well as the boundaries of existence itself. Just because an eremite might be convinced to let someone go in trade for an opportunity for a greater catch doesn't mean that once that other target is secured the eremite will cease its attempts to capture and harvest its original target. One who manages to distract and subsequently escape an eremite is well-advised to spend the rest of his life on the run. A typical eremite stands approximately 7 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. While their general form is something of a humanoid shape, exact appearances can vary wildly between eremites as they harvest and graft particularly unusual pieces of flesh to their bodies from increasingly exotic victims. <br/>",

An overlord has focused on a specific type of mutilation, and has taken that heinous surgical procedure to the outer limits of pain and pleasure. Those who worship and venerate the overlords often seek to emulate their patron's chosen mutilation, often fatally so. Overlords keep in correspondence with one another and sometimes collaborate in a Covenant of Overlords, and while they do not view each other as enemies, they are by no means allies, and often vie for the favor of the demagogues. Each overlord is a unique Large (or larger) eremite with several additional Hit Dice. In addition, each has a unique power linked to its chosen form of self-mutilation, as well as 4-6 additional spell-like abilities along that mutilation's theme. For example, an overlord that has perfected the act of skinning itself and wrapping its flesh in thorny black vines might have an ability to send those thorny vines out at great length to grapple and constrict distant foes, and might gain black tentacles, entangle, wall of thorns, and 1-3 similar spell-like abilities.</br>",

Most forest creatures acknowledge an erlking as king of the forest and arbiter in disputes between the people of the wilds. In most forests, an erlking is the brother or consort of a hamadryad, and represents the aggressive, dangerous, and vengeful aspect of the wilds. An erlking is a blur of motion on or off the battlefield, using his powers to coordinate attacks against despoilers, manipulate terrain to his side's advantage, and call in reinforcements when his forces would be overwhelmed. When his services are not needed, an erlking retires to the realm of the fey.",

      "description": "Called the Father of All Linnorms, Fafnheir is the oldest and mightiest of his kind to dwell upon Golarion-other, even more powerful linnorms exist on the First World, but on Golarion, Fafnheir is king. Crafty and powerful, Fafnheir is more than just a creature of rage or hunger, and is sometimes known to speak with those who come to him as supplicants for his wisdom. Tales say that to gain Fafnheir's advice, one must travel through Grungir Forest to the cavern entrance of the linnorm's lair, whereupon the supplicant must call into the opening several secret names for the ancient linnorm. A single step into the lair renders the supplication moot, for Fafnheir does not suffer intrusions. It is customary to bring a herd of sheep, oxen, or several thralls for him to feast upon. Those who find Fafnheir in a talkative mood and live to tell the tale report that the linnorm is well versed in numerous fields, and capable of working a wide range of magic through wishcrafting, though how much of his bragging is true is debatable. Fafnheir claims to have been the first linnorm to cross to Golarion from the First World after slaying three of that realm's Eldest, as well as to remember a time when the dragon god Dahak came to this world, and to have taken part in ancient battles against humanity as an ally of the serpentfolk. Certain Thassilonian accounts give support to his claim of providing advice and aid at times to Runelord Xanderghul, and he endured the Age of Darkness with ease. The past few thousand years have passed in the blink of an eye for the ancient linnorm, and he expects to survive for thousands more. Fafnheir is aware of the prophecy that the hero who kills him will become king of all Ulfen. The linnorm also knows that in death he will be reborn from the burnt flesh of his slayer, and suggests to those who raise this topic with him that only by becoming him can such a Linnorm King rule. While Fafnheir has seen many challengers, few have offered him a true battle. Fafnheir spends much of his time slumbering, but wakes quickly at the slightest deviation in the patterns of the world around him, and his dreaming mind touches the woods above and the blood of his children. Those who would come upon him unawares should not expect success unless they travel into his lair from other worlds, for his attunement to Grungir Forest is uncanny. The linnorm rarely ventures far from his lair, preferring to lure his enemies close and dispatch them on familiar ground. He loves nothing but his treasure, and cannot be bribed or threatened-the lure of potential treasure does not excite him nearly as much as what he already possesses. He is a subtle combatant, preferring to use trickery before launching into melee. Unlike his lesser kin, Fafnheir has a number of potent, if limited, spell-like abilities, and he often uses his limited wishes to great effect. He has long experience with direct confrontation, and his millennia of action have taught him tricks that few remember. He is one of the most deadly creatures in the Inner Sea region, and even the mightiest dragons fear his power.",

Tornado Force: The winds themselves gust at nearly 300 miles per hour, affecting all creatures in the area of effect as if they were caught in tornado-force winds.

A target whose Charisma drops to 0 becomes comatose and must immediately make a DC 32 Fortitude save or die; every 24 hours that passes thereafter, the victim must make a new Fortitude save to avoid death (unless its Charisma score rises above 0, at which point it takes 1d6 points of Charisma drain). If a creature dies from the effects of this curse, its body explodes in a 60-foot burst of burning wind, with effects identical to Fafnheir's breath weapon. This effect occurs if the cursed victim dies from any effect, not just from the curse. One round later, Fafnheir gains the effect of a true resurrection spell, appearing at the same spot where the cursed victim died (or the closest area large enough to contain the Colossal creature), with full memories of the cursed victim's doings and accomplishments while cursed. The only way to permanently slay Fafnheir is to avoid becoming cursed after killing him, or to remove the curse before the victim dies.

As their favored haunts often overlap with coastal trade routes, regions known to be within the territory of a fjord linnorm are often avoided by ships. Fjord linnorms are not particularly adept at capsizing ships, as are some other large aquatic monsters, but one might argue that such tactics are unnecessary for a creature the size and power of a fjord linnorm in the first place. Both the curse and poison of a fjord linnorm are extremely dangerous for those who frequent the waterways of the north. The fjord linnorm's curse is particularly devastating to aquatic creatures, and such beings are careful to avoid any possible conflict with such linnorms. A fjord linnorm is 60 feet long and weighs just over 10,000 pounds.",

      "description": "On the endless battlefields of the Abyss, the demon lords' vast armies clash and tear at each other in horrific displays of warfare and bloodshed. These conflicts often arise from border disputes between demonic realms, or when one demon lord finds an excuse to attack another. But many of these immense wars have no good reason at all, for gallus eagerly foment war for war's sake; they are master engineers of martial strife. These hateful, destructive demons arise from the souls of warmongers and war profiteers-nefarious leaders, corrupt priests, or subversive merchants who used their power to perpetuate existing wars or even to trigger new ones, all for the express purpose of personal gain or sadistic pleasure. Known to some as warmonger demons, the gallus are not as enormous as many of the other powerful demons; despite their near-human size, however, they are among the deadliest of demonkind. Standing 8 feet tall and weighing 450 pounds, these creatures have wolf like (but hairless) horned heads, batlike wings, and pale flesh. Their feet end in hooves, and their tails resemble those of lions. Gallus can assume humanoid shape as well, and typically do so when interacting with mortals, allowing them to more easily sow seeds of war among those they interact with. These demons are relatively difficult to summon- gate spells can conjure them from the Abyss, but few other mortal spells can call them forth. As a result, most gallus encountered outside the Abyss have traveled there via portals or similar methods. Gallus are innately crafty creatures; when coming to a new world, they resist their natural urges to destroy in favor of infiltration. Extraordinarily patient, they can spend decades or more in disguise as they subtly build their inf luence and acquire positions of power; they then use those positions to incite government officials and other powerful individuals to wage war on their neighbors. Only when the hostilities have completely devastated their host, leaving it in smoking ruins, do gallus shed their human flesh and appear in their true form to gloat and torment the conflict's few survivors before moving on to seek fresh victims. In the Worldwound, gallus serve an additional role as commanders in the numerous demonic armies. Many control multiple divisions, each led by a marilith general, and report in turn to one of the Worldwound's leaders, like Khorramzadeh, Areelu, or Aponavicius. But not all of the Worldwound's gallus command armies. Those who serve Baphomet primarily utilize their deceptive natures to infiltrate various Mendevian mercenary orders, Mammoth Lord barbarian tribes, settlements on the fringes of more civilized lands, and other factions arrayed against the Worldwound. From within those groups, they serve as advisors, urging those they've infiltrated into launching ill-timed or poorly planned attacks on their demonic foes. These gallus occasionally feed their humanoid \"allies\" legitimate intelligence about demonic fortifications or troop movements, knowing that a little truth can go a long way in encouraging mortals to act upon their more violent urges.",

A grim reaper may only assign one minor reaper to any creature at a given time, even if it uses this ability multiple times.<br/>Known by many names throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the personifications of death and all the pain and fear associated with that state.

These hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but themselves.While grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone. The towering, ghostlike grim reapers are served by minor reapers, corporeal servitors that enact their master's dreadful will and meet out death's unrelenting touch. A grim reaper is 15 feet tall and, as an incorporeal creature, has no physical weight except for its equipment. Minor reapers stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds.",

Others claim that multiple minor reapers meeting on the Negative Energy Plane or another area infused with overwhelming negative energy might join together to form a new grim reaper.While similar in shape to the psychopomps who serve Pharasma and ferry souls to their fates upon the planes, reapers care little for mortal souls, reveling in the moment of death and dissolution of the impermanent, regardless of the elaborate bureaucracy that oversees the doomed.",

Among their many powers, grim reapers can summon lesser versions of themselves to seek out and kill specific individuals.These minor reapers are encountered far more often than their masters, either in the service of their masters or summoned by evil magic-users to do their foul bidding. While stripped of their more powerful brethren's necromantic powers, these minor reapers are nonetheless brutal hunters and stop at nothing to achieve their objective. Minor reapers usually wait until their target is alone before appearing for battle, though if a pack of these undead assassins are sent after a group of victims, they will engage multiple targets if necessary.If summoned by a grim reaper, minor reapers act as its additional eyes and ears, and if they are destroyed, their master is immediately aware of their obliteration. Other times, a grim reaper may summon minor reapers to aid in its escape from a battle it expects to lose, and flees to another plane of existence where it may recover and better prepare for the annihilation of its targets.Grim reapers possess the ability to speak to any intelligent being, and the few who have survived encounters with a reaper or its minions claim that the bringer of death spoke to them in a deep, unearthly voice like nothing in the material realm.Minor reapers can be created by casters of 20th level or higher using the spell create greater undead.",

      "description": "Legends claim that the grootslang is a primordial creature as old as the world itself. Such tales state that in those ancient days, the gods-new to the crafting of things- made a terrible mistake in the grootslang's creation, for they gave it tremendous strength, cunning, and intellect. Upon realizing their mistake, the gods split the grootslang into separate creatures and thus created the first elephants and the first snakes. But one of the original grootslangs escaped, and from this first sire all other grootslangs were born. Scholars debate the veracity of such stories, and have looked to either biological or magical explanations of the creature's origins, but nevertheless bards and sages alike agree that the grootslang's fearsome reputation is well deserved. A grootslang's thick, leathery hide has a metallic sheen and a dull copper color, shot through with thin veins of green. Both males and females grow to a length of 60 feet and stand 20 feet tall. Little differentiation exists between sexes save for a lighter green hue to the female's hide. Grootslangs can weigh 20 tons and live up to 500 years. All grootslangs covet gems, particularly diamonds, and despite the creatures' lust for cruelty, victims can often bargain for their freedom by offering a grootslang enough precious gems.",

While obsessed, the target takes a -4 penalty on Will saving throws, saving throws against symbol spells, concentration checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks.

In its place, Hastur lives again, as if brought back via true resurrection. If the discarded robes are not donned within 24 hours, they fade away, leaving behind a faint yellow stain.

Any creature that looks upon an active Yellow Sign must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to avoid becoming dominated by Hastur (as dominate monster); whether or not the save is successful, the creature doesn't have to save against that Yellow Sign again for 24 hours. While the creature is under this domination effect, if the creature's Charisma drain plus Charisma damage ever equal its Charisma score, it immediately dies and allows Hastur to manifest physically at the location of its corpse, as if the victim had donned Hastur's tattered robes (see immortality). A Yellow Sign can be removed with dispel chaos, dispel evil, or erase, any of which requires the caster to succeed at a DC 35 caster level check. Mage's disjunction automatically removes a Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br>Hastur is the most mysterious of the Great Old Ones. In fact, the entity known as Hastur might actually be an Outer God. The physical manifestation of this entity is known as the King in Yellow, and though most consider this creature-a vaguely human-shaped figure draped in a yellow cloak-to be synonymous with Hastur himself, many scholars believe that the King in Yellow is nothing more than an avatar used by the true Hastur to move among the denizens of the physical world. Hastur himself is said to dwell upon a distant world called Carcosa on the shores of the monstrous Lake of Hali, and his power on a planet is strongest when the baleful light of Carcosa's star is visible in that planet's night sky. <br/></br>",

The least varieties of these symbols are nonmagical-and somewhat inaccurate-representations of the sigil, though the more powerful cults possess methods by which they can craft fully functional Yellow Signs.

      "description": "Horrifying abominations shunned by the gods immediately upon their creation, the hekatonkheires are perhaps the most powerful and devastating race of titans in existence. When the titans-envious of the gods' divine strength- rebelled against the deities, the hekatonkheires were among the first to pick up arms, weary of the scorn their own creators felt for them. The betrayal of the Elysian titans led to the hekatonkheires' swift capture by the gods, who found the hekatonkheires' power to be so immense that they were not banished to the Abyss with their Thanatotic brethren. Instead, the gods cast the hekatonkheires into the furthest reaches of the multiverse they could find. There, the hekatonkheires drifted in expanses of nothingness for unknown eons, and the madness wrought upon them by isolation destroyed their memories. Yet from their madness these shattered monstrosities spawned progeny to replace them in their pursuit to destroy, and some of these monstrous offspring discovered ways to break through planar boundaries and wander the multiverse freely. The gods initially created only three hekatonkheires, seeking to make the ultimate warriors in order to guard the gates to the Abyss. These three ancient titans still drift in the unknown expanses between planes-the hekatonkheires that now walk the worlds are their lesser spawn. But these so-called \"lesser\" titans remain almost unimaginably powerful themselves. They have no knowledge of why their forgotten ancestors were originally banished, and so they wander in search of answers, all the while destroying entire worlds. They are warped engines of mayhem, their existence based wholly on the devastation of life and anything that might remind them of their age-old war against the gods, having inherited only the haunting ghosts of such memories from their ancestors. Those hekatonkheires who have emerged back into the multiverse have done so in different realms, and to date, no record of any two of these spawn meeting one another exists. It is fortunate that only one hekatonkheires is encountered on a world at any given time, as even scholars cannot fathom the power that would arise out of two or more of the titans' collective strength. They traverse the planes alone, caring not for allies of any sort until they can remember what their purpose was when they were born eons ago. Though hekatonkheires are as intelligent as the rest of their titan relatives, they wander with such destructive and seemingly mindless intentions that they spare no time in communicating with other creatures, especially those that would beg for mercy. The hekatonkheires were created to destroy, and so that is all they desire to do; the crushing blows of their fists and the goring slashes of their weapons speak for themselves. They serve no master, and halt their otherwise endless rampage only if called by their true names, which few-if any-mortals know. Those that do know these names speak them only in whispers, for their mere utterance seems to carry with it immeasurable power. A hekatonkheires can only be called via mighty spells such as gate if a conjurer knows the plane the titan is currently on, and only if the conjurer knows the true name of the hekatonkheires it is seeking to call. Only the mad or depraved would dare such a feat, however, as the might of one of these unique goliaths is so massive that the being cannot be controlled, and even if it is banished back to the realm from whence it came, it is never long before the hekatonkheires sets its sights on the world it visited so brief ly, if only to sate its lust for destroying it. Each hekatonkheires has 50 heads and 100 arms so that one is never caught off guard. The stones that it hurls with its 100 hands are as big as boulders, and those who have seen a hekatonkheires hurl such rocks and lived to tell the tale have said that it is as though an entire mountain is falling from the sky. In addition to their unworldly strength, hekatonkheires are known for their awesome control over the powers of lightning and thunder, and an individual hekatonkheires's arrival is often prefaced by an abrupt and tumultuous storm in the area. Like all titans, hekatonkheires are immortal, and do not die unless they are slain. A hekatonkheires is 50 feet tall and weighs 25 tons.",

They often braid portions of their manes or otherwise decorate them with skulls and weapons, and prefer to wear half-plate armor and fight with longswords. The first humbabas were once the favored minions of the demon lord Pazuzu. In those days, humbabas had magnificent birdlike wings. But when the mightiest of the humbabas dared to attack Pazuzu in an ill-conceived attempt to claim the demon lord's throne, Pazuzu punished the entire humbaba race by stripping them of their wings and casting them into the Material Plane. There they now dwell, forever denied the skies and cursed to live lonely lives, incapable of forming even the barest of friendships or alliances with others of their kind.",

      "description": "The most terrible of the qlippoth, with the exception of the qlippoth lords, is doubtless the immense iathavos. Believed by many to be a singular entity, a unique qlippoth so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time, the iathavos is often encountered attended by numerous nyogoth qlippoth that squirm over its body or under its bulk, feeding upon the wastes and fragments left behind by its shuddersome passing. These nyogoths are invariably other creatures that the iathavos has absorbed and remade-they represent one of the most heinous fates that could await would-be explorers of the deepest Abyssal rifts. The iathavos crusades against the demonic scourge, but the monster does not limit its attentions to seeking out and destroying demons in preparation for the return of the Abyss to qlippoth rule. Indeed, the iathavos has the ability to shift among the various planes of the multiverse, and often travels to Material Plane worlds to systematically scour realms clean of mortal life, thus ensuring that these worlds can no longer provide the raw materials-sinful mortal souls-the Abyss relies upon to create new demons. Worlds visited by the iathavos are notable for the widespread devastation and the unusually large populations of nyogoths that remain behind to consume every last speck of decay the iathavos leaves behind. The iathavos can be called via the most powerful spells, such as gate, but its immunity to mind-affecting effects and its vast size ensure that only the most desperate or most insane ever attempt such a self-destructive act. In all known cases, the deliberate conjuration of the iathavos to another world has done little more than draw the attention of the powerful creature to that world, so that even if it is banished back to the Abyss before it can cause too much devastation, the iathavos remembers the visit. It often returns under its own power at a later date to pursue its own goals on the newly discovered world. Only if the iathavos is presented with defenders that prevent it from achieving its destructive ruin does it flee back to the Abyss via plane shift- in such cases, the qlippoth often waits for centuries or even millennia before returning to that world, for there are always easier realms to destroy. The iathavos is a powerful and horrifying monster made all the more devastating by its incredible intellect. The creature takes care to plan its major assaults on demonic enclaves or mortal cities, even though it is powerful enough that few creatures in the multiverse can give it pause. When the iathavos is slain, the multiverse typically has only a relatively short time before the Abyss births a replacement monstrosity for the defeated qlippoth. This newly born iathavos is an entirely new creature-it does not share the memories of the previous incarnation, nor does it possess any advanced hit dice or class levels the previous monster may have gained, yet its appetite and hatred for demonic life and the sins that create such life remain constant and unending. To call such an iathavos a \"newborn\" is somewhat misleading. Although technically a freshly created creature, newborn iathavoses do not undergo a \"childhood.\" They form fully grown, as presented here. Yet with each new incarnation of the qlippoth monstrosity, changes can occur. A new iathavos might have slightly different spell-like abilities, for example, or the nature of its horrific appearance might change from that presented here. As an iathavos continues to hunt and destroy, it grows more powerful-an advanced iathavos typically gains more racial Hit Dice as a result. An iathavos that gains power by taking class levels is not unheard of, but it is quite rare- most who do take levels in sorcerer.",

A patient being, he uses his special ability to seek solitude in magma chambers, in massive volcanoes, and along the edges of grinding tectonic plates. It's rumored that many of Golarion's greatest earthquakes and volcanic eruptions were either facilitated by or witnessed by Ifestus. He was slumbering in a great volcano in Casmaron when Earthfall struck, and wandered the surface of the planet for a decade thereafter before finally settling into Mount Keeba. Quiet for thousands of years, Ifestus now rumbles and stirs.",

Over time these seals break or erode, allowing a trickle of an ooze's substance to escape and giving it a narrow aperture to exert its power through. Retaining vague memories of the god it was taken from, an immortal ichor uses its minions to find a body to possess, and either sets itself up as a godling or tries to find a way to revive its divine source.",

Small or smaller creatures in this area that fail a DC 15 Strength check are blown away. See page 439 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for further details on the effects of severe winds.<br>The jabberwock is a true creature of legend-a subject of poetry, song, and myth in many cultures. It is known to be a devastating creature in combat whose arrival presages times of ruin and violence; these stories also tell of the creature's fear of the tools some say were created in ancient times for the sole purpose of defeating them- vorpal weapons. A jabberwock is 35 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds. the Tane are presented in this book-the sard and the thrasfyr. None of the Tane are lower than CR 16 in power and all possess the planar acclimation special quality, but beyond that, they generally share no specific abilities or characteristics save for their common source in the primal world. When a jabberwock comes to the Material Plane, it does so to spread destruction and ruin. Typically, the monster seeks out a remote forest lair at least a day's flight from civilization, then emerges from this den once a week to seek out a new place to destroy. It has no true interest in amassing treasure, but often gathers objects of obvious value to bring back to its den in order to encourage heroes to seek it out-to a jabberwock, it makes no difference whether it seeks out things to destroy or lets those things come to it. Jabberwocks age, eat, drink, and sleep like any living creature, but they do not reproduce in the classic sense of the word. The creation of a new jabberwock-or of any of the Tane, in fact-is regulated by the strange and unknowable godlike entities that dwell in the primeval world. These fey lords create new jabberwocks as they are needed-sometimes varying the exact particulars (see Variant Jabberwocks, below), but always creating a fully formed adult creature. No young jabberwock has ever been encountered as a result. The strange vulnerability a jabberwock possesses against vorpal weapons has long been a matter of intrigue and speculation among scholars. Most believe that, once upon a time, only one jabberwock existed, a creature of such great power that nothing could hurt it. Nothing, that is, save for a legendary sword forged for a mortal hero by a now-forgotten artisan or god. So epic was this battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of the vorpal swords and jabberwocks known today, can be found on many worlds. <br/></br>",

            "description": "<br> The notion of a \"lesser\" jabberwock is something of a misnomer, for even these creatures are powerful foes. A lesser jabberwock is generally a CR 20 version of the typical jabberwock-you can achieve a creature of this power by lowering the typical jabberwock's Hit Dice by 3 and by reducing its ability scores by 4 points each. Alternatively, you can apply the young creature simple template, but bear in mind that such a monster isn't technically any younger than a typical jabberwock. As creatures from the primal world of the fey, some jabberwocks are as varied as the strange terrains and The jabberwock is not a creature of the Material Plane, but one from the primal world of the fey. It comes from a region of reality where life is more robust, where emotions are more potent, and where dreams and nightmares can come alive. Even in such incredible realms, though, the jabberwock is a creature to be feared. It belongs to a category of powerful creatures whose shapes and types run the gamut of possibility-a group known collectively as the \"Tane.\" Of the Tane, the jabberwock is said to be the most powerful, but the others in this grouping are far from helpless. Said to have been created as goliaths of war and madness, dreamt and stitched into being by the strange gods of this primeval reality, the Tane are as mysterious as they are powerful. Two other creatures of realms in that primal world, as if these environs have more to do with their manifestation than most scholars suspect. Generally, these changes simply alter the type of damage a jabberwock's eye beams deal and the types of energy it is immune to. A jabberwock from a primeval glacial world would possess eye beams that deal cold damage, while a jabberwock from a storm-lashed world would deal electricity damage with its eye beams. If the nature of a jabberwock's eye beams change, its burn ability changes to match, and it replaces its immunity to fire with immunity to the new energy type (while gaining resist fire 30 in place of the lost immunity to fire).</br>",

As long as it is within its territory (either merged with it or in its physical form), a jinushigami can observe the world from any point within its regional ward as if it were at that point. While merged with its ward, it can observe all points simultaneously in this way. As a standard action, it can convey information about a creature within its ward (effectively imparting a description and exact location) to all kami within its regional ward.<br/>Guardians of significant natural wonders like mountains, large lakes, forests, and so on, jinushigami (known also as land kami) are the most powerful and revered of all kami, commanding the very forces of nature itself to ensure the safety and security of their wards. These potent spirits garner the most respect among other kami, wielding great inf luence over both them and the native creatures that dwell within their territories. Jinushigami tend to stay hidden amongst their land, however, knowing that their intimate tie with the environment makes them highly desirable targets among those who would seek to do harm to nature. Strangers to lands protected by jinushigami are well-advised to take the utmost care to not offend the powerful spirit creatures. When displeased, jinushigami can eradicate trails and warp the contours of their terrain, forcing travelers to endure unreasonable hardship in travel. These goliaths have little patience for those who would defile their efforts, and offenders who fail to listen to a jinushigami's initial hints quickly discover how devastating the kami's powers can be as they are forced from the land either by the lesser kami who serve their superior or by the towering jinushigami itself. Of course, those who respect and honor the jinushigami see the kami's other side, as the kami eases their travel by lessening undergrowth, shifting rivers, and otherwise providing subtle but incredible aid to travelers. Jinushigami are ancient and wise, and while they are no fools, they prefer to give visitors to their domains the benefit of the doubt. Only when an individual makes known his disruptive intentions toward the structure and cohesion of nature does a jinushigami react with violence. Of course, those who align themselves with naturally opposing forces of the kami, such as the oni, do not receive this friendly grace period, and a jinushigami can perceive most treacherous thoughts, sensing a suspicious visitor through its connection with the land, then tracking it down to stealthily observe it more closely.

Newly formed jinushigami have statistics as presented above, but a jinushigami grows more powerful as the legend and fame of the site it guards grows. For example, a jinushigami of part of a mountain range is impressive, but a jinushigami whose region includes the range's tallest mountain is even more so. When a jinushigami becomes this powerful, it is known as an elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami is generally a Colossal creature, and rarely has fewer than 28 Hit Dice-most are between CR 22 and CR 25, although exact details vary. An elder jinushigami's ward can cover a much larger area than that of a typical jinushigami, usually with a radius of 1 mile per CR possessed by the elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami also gains additional spell-like abilities to more closely ref lect its role in the world. Listed below are several examples. <br/></br>",

But because a kaminari possesses incredible resilience to such effects, any silence or deafening effect lasts only 2d4 rounds or as long as the effect's duration states, whichever is shorter.* See the Advanced Player's Guide.<br/>Kaminaris are robust spirits of enormous size that watch over the balance of weather, taking the form of violent storms wherever they go. More monstrous-looking and boisterous than most kami, kaminaris are often mistaken for oni upon first glance, their unpredictable natures furthering the confusion. Kaminaris care little for most mortals, primarily concerning themselves with the maintenance and protection of their wards- enormous storm clouds that represent the awesome power of thunder and lightning. In addition to their duties guarding their storm wards and the balance of weather, kaminaris are endlessly fascinated with musical instruments, particularly drums. Kaminaris have vibrant skin and equally colorful features; the specific hues vary from kaminari to kaminari. A kaminari stands roughly 25 feet tall and weighs about 10 tons.",

            "description": "Though a kaminari commands the awe-inspiring powers of lightning and thunder as though they were simply extensions of itself, the kami of storms have limited power over their wards. As dictated by the obscure and convoluted Laws of Golden Perfection, a kaminari has only limited ability to will its ward to travel in any particular direction or halt its movement for a modest amount of time per day. Thus it is often merely a passenger upon the clouds of a storm. Though most storms collect and dissipate with some frequency, a kami-inhabited storm is more permanent than most weather patterns, and as long as both the kami and its ward are neither destroyed nor corrupted, the storm could exist for a potentially infinite amount of time. Kaminaris despise the use of magic to alter weather patterns, and attempts to disrupt their storm clouds often result in the enormous kami's unabashed and wrathful ire. A kaminari is as volatile as the storm it protects, and the powerful spirit is quick to exterminate any creature-mortal or otherwise-it deems a threat to the natural balance of weather. Whether an evil sorcerer is trying to bring devastation to a seaside town by calling forth powerful hurricanes or a benevolent wizard is summoning rain to save a desert city in the midst of a natural drought, if such manipulation comes to the attention of the watchful and wandering kaminaris, they find little forgiveness. This is not to suggest that the kami of storms are evil-their threshold for nuisances is simply lower than most kami, and their punishments more destructive.",

            "description": "Floating thousands of feet above most civilizations, kaminaris are usually isolated from other creatures, and this suits the reclusive kami just fine. A kaminari does not interfere with the matters of mortals beyond the natural destruction caused by its storm clouds, and only aides such diminutive creatures when the task would be required of it because of some stricture of the Laws of Golden Perfection. Once a kaminari has fulfilled its required duty, it is only too happy to continue on its way, where it can remain uninterrupted as it creates its music and fills the air around it with thunder and lightning. A kaminari is as devoted to its ward as it is to the practice of music, and the intensity of the storm it sits upon usually corresponds to the amount of aggression with which it plays its instrument. While it rarely cares to interact with mortals, tending first and foremost to its ward, a kaminari may entertain the idea of interacting with a fellow virtuoso. Kaminaris thus have a great affection for bards who practice an instrument, and will occasionally interrupt their diligent guardianship of their storm if doing so allows them the opportunity to play with a skillful accompanist. Amateurs need not apply, as the immortal kaminaris are often among the best players of their instruments, commanding powers of music so stirring that even the most talented bard might have trouble keeping up. A kaminari goes to great lengths to surround itself with booming noise, and is rarely seen without its instrument of choice. While most kaminaris prefer to use drums and other percussion instruments to fill the air around them with sound, rare individuals also adhere to the use of keyboard, string, and wind instruments. The powers of these kaminaris do not greatly differ, but their choice of instrument is usually a fair indicator of their temperament as well as the kind of storm they travel upon-those who play keyboards are usually found amid desert-quenching storms that wander arid environments, bringing with them the power of tornadoes and dust storms; players of string instruments tend toward oceanic environs, residing within the hearts of devastating hurricanes of incredible magnitude far out at sea; and kaminaris who use wind instruments occupy blizzards, commanding the powers of the ice and snow that constantly whip about them.",

They gnaw and scratch and grind away at the edges of the universe, the planar junctures where the folds of creation bend in upon themselves. They have an uncanny sense for finding natural rifts, portals, and convergences, and they seek ever for ways to expand and untether these natural gates. By setting them loose to drift across the world, they unhinge the orderly substrate of the multiverse, casting all into primordial chaos as the planes unravel. Their voices are strange and echoing, like several voices sounding together, each distorted and cacophonous and rising and falling asynchronously in pitch and volume. When not actively engaged in a task, katpaskirs tend to stand perfectly still, with the exception of its insectlike limbs, which rhythmically stroke the air in front of them. When other creature come near-or if some teleporting creature triggers the demon's warp sense special ability-it snaps out of this self-imposed stasis, ready to attack.

For them, the anarchic dissolution of society was only a harbinger of the very real disintegration of all that is. These fiends are a natural fit for the armies of Deskari, and indeed, katpaskirs have been used by the Locust Lord for many eons as apocalyptic leaders and generals in his plane-spanning campaigns.

To katpaskirs, mortals are part of the reality that must be destroyed, not the implements of its destruction. They may make brief use of humanoid minions, but at their earliest opportunity they devour and destroy those seeking to serve them, unleashing a horde of fiendish terrors to finish their mission of ultimate destruction. Crazed cultists of Deskari and powerful members of the Blackfire Adepts sometimes call upon katpaskirs to help the group create new portals to Deskari's Rasping Rifts or tear rifts between worlds, but such humanoids know that such a summoning ensures their own final reckoning as well. Katpaskirs are drawn to newly opened rifts and thin places between the planes.

      "description": "It is rumored that the khala was a rare breed of amphibious dragon before Baba Yaga came to Golarion. Her arrival and the supernatural winter that came with her warped these once-proud creatures into voracious, wicked things that delight in the suffering of others. Each of a khala's three heads can strike at a separate target, though if two or more heads hit a single target, they cause horrific wounds as they viciously fight to devour chunks of its flesh. Along with suffering terrible injuries, those bitten by a khala risk contracting chillbane fever, a disease unique to Irrisen. The creature can ambulate like a snake, slithering along the ground or through the boughs of trees with its batlike wings drawn close to its body, but it prefers flight whenever possible. The khala's breath weapon, usable by a single head every 1d4 rounds, is a jet of freezing liquid that freezes on contact, trapping the target in ice. All khala are female, and scholars debate how the creature procreates. Some believe that the males of the species, known in legend as the zmey, were wiped out in a war with the khala prior to Baba Yaga's arrival.",

While he loves and respects his fellow empyreal lords for their tireless fight against wickedness, Korada believes good's final triumph will come from the redemption of evil creatures rather than their destruction. Honest, joyful, and clever, the Open Hand of Harmony dispenses wisdom with warmth and humility, and freely shares the secrets he has amassed over ages of study and meditation. Korada's dedication to philosophy and introspection have garnered him the ability to read the diverse threads of the world, see their nearly limitless connections, and then act on them with uncanny foresight. With neither the na\u00efvety of youth nor the jaded weariness of age, Korada is a perfect balance of sentient intelligence and animal instinct, at home wherever he is. Though he can assume many forms, Korada's true appearance is a slender, athletic man wearing a simple monk's robe. He has a golden monkey-like beard and sideburns, three monkey tails, and a light layer of downy golden fur covering the rest of his body. On Nirvana, Korada dwells in the Dream Lotus, a serene palace city whose blossoming violet walls always drip with cool, golden nectar that is said to calm even the wildest of spirits. It's a place of refuge and healing, and no violence is allowed within its walls; those with problems controlling their anger are sent to meditate at one of its many calming sacred pools. Korada is said to possess the gift of foresight, but he rarely acts on these strange visions. He believes the struggle to change is always worthwhile, even if such a journey does not always end in success. It's the process, not the result, that matters most to Korada. Despite his staunch dedication to peace, Korada's skill in battle is respected, and he's able to utilize almost any fighting style without a second's pause. He may be responsible for inspiring or teaching the animal combat styles to mortals, using various guises over the course of history on many worlds-or he may even have persuaded the creator gods to give the animals their instincts and talents for fighting, which led to mortals studying and emulating animal combat styles. Korada's reputation for peace and martial skill earned him the role of the diplomat of the empyreal lords and their celestial armies. Balor lords, demodand warlords, and even infernal dukes have (temporarily) abandoned their dreams of conquest and warmongering when the Open Hand of Harmony has arrived-alone-in their court to suggest that they consider a different path. These visits always leave behind a path of dazed and stunned fiends, surprised and awed by how easily he defeated them; most silently suffer this indignation and plan vengeance for the next time he appears. Although Korada is usually serene and gentle, he has a mischievous side and has been known to poke fun at or harass his opponents like a capricious monkey. He combines his skill in battle and gift for trickery to lead dangerous opponents away from innocents or into places where they can more easily be captured or subdued. That said, Korada abhors violence, and he prefers to make nonlethal attacks (using his primal aura and tranquil master abilities), disabling foes so he can speak to them of their weakness. He dispatches mindless opponents without hesitation, not wanting to waste energy debating or persuading a thing empty of thoughts and incapable of making moral choices. He challenges enemy leaders to single combat if doing so would prevent violence between other combatants. <br/></br>",

The empyreal lord's sacred places are diplomatic embassies, mountain monasteries, and wells. Korada's holy symbol is two devotees kneeling before a lotus or a golden monkey with three tails.

This attack of opportunity has a critical threat range of 18-20. Against female targets, the vengeful strike is also a crushing blow.<br>Kostchtchie (pronounced kosh-TIK-ti-kai) appears as an immense, deformed frost giant with twisted legs, tiny white eyes, and a thick matted beard into which are woven dozens of skulls-trophies of mortal kings and priests of rival faiths he has slain. Legends speak that each of these skulls is haunted by the ghost of its previous owner, and that he can commune with these spirits to seek their wisdom-although if the legends are true, it is more likely that Kostchtchie has little interest in anything but mockery and torment for these lost souls. Kostchtchie is never seen without his massive warhammer, an adamantine maul of such prodigious size that even the strongest frost giant would have trouble wielding it properly. Known also as the Deathless Frost, Kostchtchie dwells in an immense Abyssal fortress carved from the heart of a towering mountain in a frozen realm of jagged mountains and immense glaciers infested with manifold frozen horrors. Kostchtchie stands 30 feet tall. Kostchtchie was born of human parents, and became a murderer when his father forced him to kill his mother and sisters. Kostchtchie went one better and murdered his father as well. Later in life, after he had become a ferocious warlord well known for the slaying of dozens of giant chieftains, he confronted the Witch Queen Baba Yaga and tried to force her to grant him immortality-she agreed, but twisted his form, turned him into a hideous giant, and hid away the last fragment of his mortal soul in a magical torc. Kostchtchie fled to the Abyss to nurture his hatred and hide his shame, eventually finding a new purpose as a patron of frost giants despite his hatred of their kind. Kostchtchie longs for the recovery of the torc that contains the fragment of his soul, in the hope that its return might reverse his deformity without removing his immortality. In combat, Kostchtchie almost always uses Power Attack, taking a -8 penalty on all attack rolls but gaining a +16 bonus on damage rolls. The Deathless Frost is often accompanied by several frost giants, at least two of which are clerics. These clerics attend his every need, healing him in battle as best they can lest they forfeit their lives-or fall to some fate even more dire at the merciless hands of the Deathless Frost. <br/></br>",

This tight skin makes the creature's sharp eyes bulge from their sockets. Unlike mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs have no need to eat or sleep and consider the need for either activity a weakness. Labyrinth minotaurs don't age as mortal creatures do; over the centuries of their existence as guardians and enforcers, they instead accumulate masses of battle scars, which they wear with arrogant pride. Labyrinth minotaurs speak little, but make a lot of noise. They breathe in great snorts, bang their weapons against their armor, and stomp their steel-shod hooves on the ground as they walk. Labyrinth minotaurs seethe with anger and energy, constantly moving about and shifting from hoof to hoof when required to stand in place for more than a few minutes. A labyrinth minotaur prefers to range throughout the narrow, turning corridors of its maze-like hunting grounds, even into dead ends and back, searching for hints of intruders upon which it can vent its bestial fury.",

            "description": "The first minotaurs were created by Lamashtu, and the first and greatest of these creations was none other than Baphomet. These minotaurs came into existence on Golarion in the vast mazes beneath Iblydos. After becoming a demon lord, Baphomet collected the souls of these primal minotaurs and forged them into the labyrinth minotaurs, paragons of their kind and Baphomet's favored servants. The labyrinth minotaurs constantly patrol the twisting pathways of the Ivory Labyrinth to enforce Baphomet's will on lesser denizens of the domain (such as mortal minotaurs and cultists) and to challenge intruders. Labyrinth minotaurs are as bestial as their mortal kin and prone to outbursts of violent rage, but their high status in Baphomet's service makes them haughty and given to boasting. They feel contemptuous disdain for all mortal creatures but are particularly derisive of mortal creatures lost or confounded by mazes. Like mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs are perfectly at home in mazes of any kind and are incapable of becoming lost. This affinity for mazes applies to their thinking as well-despite their brutish demeanors, labyrinth minotaurs are good with puzzles and are keen tactical thinkers. When labyrinth minotaurs meet in peace, they sometimes exchange inscrutable riddles or short descriptive puzzles (such as, \"How would you drink a drop of blood inside a severed eyeball while it's in an iron coffer sunk to the bottom of a well without getting wet or being seen by the eye?\"). Labyrinth minotaurs prefer gear and armor made of bronze and steel, as few other materials are sufficiently sturdy for them to use over a long period of time. In addition to their steel shoes, heavy armor, and massive greataxes, all labyrinth minotaurs wear heavy bronze masks. Each labyrinth minotaur makes its own mask, and some spend weeks or even months obsessively shaping and reshaping the bronze over hot forges. At first glance, each of these bronze masks might seem superficially similar, but upon closer inspection a viewer can clearly see the subtle embellishments built in by the individual labyrinth minotaur. These flourishes communicate the minotaur's status and history to other servants of Baphomet. A labyrinth minotaur often adds an embellishment to its mask when it accomplishes an important task on Baphomet's behalf or kills a particularly powerful intruder. A labyrinth minotaur's obsession makes its mask more than mere ornamentation- each is mystically connected to its mask. Labyrinth minotaurs prefer to patrol alone or in small gangs. They maintain a central communal headquarters that's usually crewed by about six members, with the fiercest labyrinth minotaur commanding the others through bullying and intimidation. This headquarters is concealed deep within a maze and serves as a safe storage area, a locus for discussing strategy, and the site of the gang's forge and metalworking tools. When labyrinth minotaurs meet others of their kind while out patrolling a maze, they usually share a short exchange of riddles or boasts. Occasionally, labyrinth minotaurs recognize each other as being on opposite sides of sprawling, ancient rivalries. In such cases, the first labyrinth minotaur to recognize the other as an enemy surges forward with murderous fury, hoping to catch its rival off guard. Large congregations of labyrinth minotaurs are rare-even when large groups don't engage in these feuds, labyrinth minotaurs fall into divisive boasting that frequently erupts into bloodshed anyway. Labyrinth minotaurs are rarely encountered outside of the Ivory Labyrinth, and therefore have little interaction with other races beyond visitors to their master's realm. Labyrinth minotaurs display grudging respect for glabrezu and vilsteth demons and undisguised contempt for mortal minotaurs and cultists of Baphomet. Their arrogance precludes true camaraderie with anyone other than those of their own kind.",

Where a human would have legs, it instead possesses a complex orb of spinning rings similar in shape to an orrery-it is this whirling machine that grants the lhaksharut the ability to fly. Though a lhaksharut has huge, metal wings, they serve as little more than stabilizers when it's in flight. Four of the construct's arms end in functional hands that it normally uses to carry a mix of weapons. The lhaksharut's lower two arms hold large, flaming metal spheres in their hands-it uses these spheres to generate elemental bolts of energy that it can hurl great distances to damage foes. Lhaksharuts are tasked with maintaining the separation between different planes of reality, especially the elemental planes. They do not concern themselves with petty trespasses by visitors from one plane to another, nor even the occasional creation of a pocket plane or hijacking of a chunk of one reality to serve as a base within another. What does trouble a lhaksharut is anything that represents a permanent link between planes, or an effort by the denizens of one plane to invade and conquer another. They often find themselves in conf lict with the machinations of powerful outsiders who seek to create beachheads on other planes to serve as launching pads for massive incursions.",

      "description": "Lilitu demons are subversive and hidden horrors, demons who work much more subtlety in their constant quest to destroy and devastate. Whereas most demons prefer to rend and destroy, the lilitu is more akin to the succubus-she labors in humanoid guise to infect society from within with sin. Known to some as temptation demons, lilitus enjoy little more than leading mortals into all matter of sinful acts, in the hopes that when the mortal perishes, that soul will fuel the Abyss. Despite some superf icial similarities to succubi, lilitus are not solely concerned with the sin of lust. The exact nature of sin that a lilitu tempts a mortal into committing varies, for these demons are adept at reading mortal desires and secrets, quickly discerning which sinful acts a specif ic target can be convinced to perform. Lilitus have numerous tools at their disposal for the encouragement of promoting sin, but they much prefer their humanoid victims to commit sins of their own free will. As such, lilitus generally use their abilities to deceive and beguile mortals rather than forcing them to execute these heinous acts. A son convinced to kill for his mother (the disguised lilitu) to rectify a grave injustice done to her produces more delight than simply mind-controlling a humanoid into doing such a deed. In her true form, a lilitu appears as an eyeless, horned, snake-tailed-but otherwise beautiful-human woman. Despite her lack of eyes, a lilitu can see with supernatural ease. A lilitu forms from the soul of a mortal who lured others of its kind to commit sins. Lilitus serve many demon lords, although the demon lords associated with the classic seven deadly sins- Areshkagal (greed), Jubilex (sloth), Nocticula (lust), Orcus (wrath), Shax (envy), Socothbenoth (pride), and Xoveron (gluttony)-are their favorites. Lilitus who serve these seven demon lords are unique in appearance, ref lecting their sins more physically than others of their kind. A lilitu of Jubilex might appear to be made of slime, while a lilitu of Xoveron might be morbidly obese. Lilitus typically stand 6 feet tall and weigh 130 pounds.",

            "description": "Each time a lilitu damages a living creature with her tail slap, the wound leaves an angry and permanent red brand. In addition, the creature struck becomes staggered for 1 round from the pain. A successful DC 26 Will save negates the staggered condition and reduces the duration of the brand from permanent to 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based. Removing brands is difficult-each casting of restoration, dispel chaos, or dispel evil removes 1 brand. Heal removes 1d4+4 brands. Greater restoration removes a number of brands equal to the spell's caster level. Miracle and wish can remove all brands at once. The number of brands a creature gains in this manner has a cumulative series of effects, as summarized below. 1-3 Brands: The lilitu can affect the branded creature with its create husk, husk link, and profane pact abilities. 4-6 Bands: The branded creature takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves made against a lilitu's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The branded creature's aura now radiates chaos and evil. 7-9 Brands: The branded creature's Wisdom score is reduced by 4.

A successful DC 26 Fortitude save negates this effect, allowing the victim to die normally. A humanoid transformed into a husk withers away into an immobile and desiccated corpse, but does not actually die-in this state, the creature remains aware of its surroundings but can take no actions at all. A husk is essentially treated as an object with hardness 15 and 60 hit points. If a husk is destroyed, the effect ends and the body dies. This is a curse effect- removing this curse restores the victim to life at a number of negative hit points equal to the creature's Constitution -1; a husk restored to life in this way has 1 round to stabilize or be saved before it dies. A lilitu can maintain a number of husks simultaneously equal to her Charisma modifier (8 husks for the typical lilitu); if she creates one too many husks, a previously created husk is released and immediately dies. Lilitus hide their husk collections in very safe places. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

The husk link allows a lilitu to use her change self ability to assume a husk's original form-when she does, she gains a +20 bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate that person. If a lilitu with an active husk link ever takes enough damage to be slain, the husk takes the killing-blow's damage instead and is destroyed, instantly severing the active husk link; if the lilitu is disguised in the husk's original form, she instantly reverts to her true form.",

      "description": "Lorthact the Unraveler, also named the Dwimmerlaik, the Ur-Magius, and the Diabolus Mystere, was once a high-ranking duke of Hell. Atypically, he was not solely bound to the service of a single archdevil, instead serving openly at various times as a mystical advisor and consultant on magical matters under both Geryon and Mephistopheles. Some believed him to be secretly a favorite of Asmodeus himself; this supposed favor provided some measure of protection from his jealous rivals. His last mistress in Hell was Eiseth, Whore-Queen of the erinyes, but when Eiseth uncovered a plot to reverse their positions-Lorthact arrogating himself to lordship and reducing her to mere consort-her wrath was enormous and eternal. Lorthact's allies deserted him lest they taste the fury of the erinyes. Lorthact proclaimed his innocence, but he saw condemnation awaiting and fled, racing across the planes with the whips of the erinyes at his heels. After several planar refuges proved no shelter from his relentless pursuers, Lorthact sought solace in the mortal realms. Laying several false leads, he then doubled back to the diabolists of Cheliax, the first place his pursuers looked for him on Golarion. But after they had moved on, he slipped back into places they thought already thoroughly scoured. Adopting a succession of guises, he kept his presence hidden for years, but he never felt truly comfortable under the gaze of so many potentially unfriendly eyes. Seeking a more remote locale, he traveled to the farthest reaches of Chelish sovereignty: the Varisian city-state of Korvosa. There he found the perfect patsy in the vain and corrupt Lord Volshyenek Ornelos. Rebuffed by House Thrune in his quest to restore his youth and vigor, Volshyenek was easy prey for Lorthact's inveigling. The devil bound him in a web of lies and stole not only his soul but also his life. Impersonating Lord Ornelos for over 200 years, he became a dominant figure in Korvosa, shadow-master of the Acadamae and sire of a great house. Meanwhile, he sought ways to rebuild his diabolic power and his store of souls so one day he might buy his way back to ducal favor in Hell. In the end, Eiseth's diabolic assassins found him at long last, and he was forced to fake his own death. Yet he still dominates Korvosa from the shadows, controlling the Acadamae through his descendant Toff Ornelos. Little happens in the city without his knowledge, and he plays the part of the mage through shadow-magic, illusions, limited wishes, and the stolen magic of others. However, casters who delve too deeply into his or Korvosa's secrets find themselves at odds with the deadly duke, his powers honed by centuries of exile to undermine and destroy mages who might uncover his identity or unravel his schemes.",

Ravenous and unpredictable, a lusca claims wide swaths of territory in order to maximize the number of ships it can sink and crews it can feast upon. While luscas prefer to make quick meals of the sailors onboard a ship, they will eat just about any aquatic creature, and even giant octopuses and whales know to steer clear of a hungry lusca.

            "description": "A maharaja casts arcane spells as an 18th-level sorcerer.<br/>All rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for whom this hunger is more than an obsession: It's a birthright. Legends among the rakshasas tell of the maharajas-those rakshasas whose depredations and acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their kind and allowed them to reincarnate as embodiments of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference of their lessers, maharajas inspire one emotion within the rakshasa race that few can: fear. A maharaja rakshasa emerges only after a rakshasa of great power and inf luence has spent several lives as a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa's social-spiritual caste system. When a rakshasa ascends to maharaja status, others of its kind take notice, with rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young maharaja-eager to curry its favor at an early age. The birth of a maharaja denotes that great change is imminent: The maharaja will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a lasting nation of rakshasas, undergo some manner of divine ascension, or defeat some greater foe and commandeer its domain, often splitting the region into large enough chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more than a handful of maharajas to emerge in the same century. So great is a maharaja's power and inf luence and so long is its life that one can spend most of its time enjoying the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its servitors-often charmed or dominated humanoids, or, if the maharaja is powerful enough, good-aligned outsiders-lounging in opulence. The lair of a maharaja is typically a glorious, decadent mansion. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree decorates the columns, and great friezes embossed with rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather than couches or divans, luxurious pillows stuffed with exotic feathers and crafted from the hides of even rarer creatures serve for furniture, and all about hang the trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the heads of failed lieutenants. A maharaja's great experience and power, however, does not make it immune to or ignorant of threats. Disloyal servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling adventurers all might step forth to challenge a maharaja's rule. To that end, a maharaja employs devious methods to ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats. Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control, most rakshasa maharajas have several secluded palaces and lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly.",

            "description": "Each maharaja is unique, the process of its evolution granting it strengths and weaknesses that differentiate the being from all before it. Over its lifetimes, its path teaches it myriad lessons and grants distinctive powers. A typical maharaja is a master of divination, enchantment, and illusion. Other maharajas master various other techniques, such as necromancy or conjuration. As a maharaja continues to grow in malignant might, its powers outstrip those even of its peers. It might ultimately ascend to the rank of rajadhiraja-a king of kings. Even more so than the maharajas, the rajadhirajas are unique beings. A rajadhiraja is never lower than CR 21-most have additional racial Hit Dice beyond the standard maharaja. Each additional racial Hit Die granted increases the rakshasa's CR by +1, but also increases its effective sorcerer caster level by +1 and grants a new spell-like ability that follows that rakshasa's personal theme and philosophy. A rajadhiraja that fancies itself a master of space and time might gain the ability to use greater teleport three times per day or the use of time stop once per day, while one who sees itself as a master of forms might gain the ability to use shapechange once per day or polymorph at will. A master of combat might instead gain additional damaging spell-like abilities. The type of new spell-like abilities the rakshasa gains can be selected as needed-8th- and 9th-level spells should be usable once per day, 5th- through 7th-level spells usable three times per day, and spells lower than 5th level at will, though even these guidelines can be adjusted as you see fit to make a more interesting rajadhiraja. The cycle of reincarnation and the faint memories it imparts provide rajadhirajas with the distinct power to manipulate life and death according to this cycle. A rajadhiraja can use its mastery of reincarnation to alter these cycles for other creatures, and as a result, all rajadhirajas gain the following special ability in addition to their other powers. Reincarnate (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a rajadhiraja can bring a dead creature back to life as if using the reincarnate spell, except that the target must have been dead less than 1 day and can have been killed by a death effect. As with any effect that restores life to a creature, the reincarnating creature can choose not to be reincarnated if it wishes, but if it does allow the effect to happen, it returns to life at full capacity, as if restored via true resurrection in a new form. Some rajadhirajas slay their own allies in combat, then use this ability to in order to allow the allies to continue the battle in a new body. The new form granted by this effect can be any form within one size category of the dead creature's original size-the exact form of this new body is chosen by the rajadhiraja. Use the results listed in the Core Rulebook for the reincarnate spell as guidelines for determining the new body's physical ability score adjustments.",

      "description": "Mogaru, known as the Final King to kaiju scholars, or simply as King Mogaru, is one of the most destructive of his kind. Although not the most powerful kaiju (a sobering thought in and of itself ), Mogaru is certainly the most active of the known kaiju. Additionally, Mogaru seems to be as eager to rampage through the works of humanity as he is to attack and kill other kaiju, making him something of a mixed blessing to kaiju-threatened cities. While the prospect of an attack by Mogaru is the stuff of nightmares, the possibility of his intervention during a different kaiju attack is the stuff of hope, though the damage dealt to a city during its defense may be significant. Mogaru appears as a towering dinosaur with twin tails, spines that glow red as he uses his breath weapon, and two powerful clawed forearms. King Mogaru dwells in the depths of a tropical jungle, sleeping silently at the bottom of an unusually deep lake until roused. Legends hold that Mogaru was born of the world itself, either formed from the spirits of countless plants and animals resulting from ages of hunting and predation by humanoids for food or sport, or formed from the souls of the countless slain in an ancient apocalypse or war that devastated one of the first of the world's empires. Regardless of the actual cause, the birth of Mogaru in these legends seems to be the same-soon after another kaiju, Lord Varklops, emerged from an erupting volcano, Mogaru rose to oppose the Thrice-Headed Fiend in a vast battle that nearly slew Varklops while devastating an entire nation in the process. Mogaru is also rumored to have slain no fewer than a dozen other kaiju, including Agmazar the Star Titan, now believed to be the only undead kaiju in existence. Of particular note is the curious fact that Mogaru exhibits a particularly unique interest in song. Legends of skilled singers being able to save their cities with a single mournful paean to the kaiju, or of vengeful bards using their craft to waken the monster from his lair to send him on a rampage are common along coastal regions with a history of kaiju attacks, and in such regions renowned singers are well respected for this ability to inf luence one of the world's most destructive creatures. Kaiju scholars suspect that song manages to penetrate Mogaru's memories of some primeval event, but the reasons for the kaiju's reaction to the song are its own. Mogaru stands 140 feet high and weighs 20,000 tons, and is nearly 300 feet long from nose to tail.",

      "description": "Moxix, the Drinker of Human Hopes, is a unique demon bound to the mysterious isle called Yoha's Graveyard in the Shackles. Appearing as an eldritch four-armed statue of weathered gray stone, Moxix has a single emerald eye centered in his horrible face. A nest of twisted horns rests atop his head, and his fang-f illed maw is perpetually stained with blood. Those courageous explorers traveling to his seemingly idyllic isle are driven mad by strange visions and dreams, or by inscrutable but disturbing carvings, idols, and glyphs that litter the island. Even if they withstand the island's maddening magic, adventurers in search of legendary lost riches may confront Moxix himself and be scourged of mind, body, and soul. Moxix's baleful presence and malevolent awareness leer from every crudely carved icon, relief, and idol bearing his likeness, bringing with them a tinge of insanity and a ravenous hunger for human flesh. Ghosts and pentagram-branded cannibals and lunatics are all that remain of ill-fated expeditions to Yoha's Graveyard. Moxix found his first worshipers among the terrible cyclopes of Ghol-Gan as their civilization fell into ruin. As the one-eyed giants slipped more and more into depravity and violence, they began worshiping foul, otherworldly creatures their brothers and sisters brought up from the vaults of the Darklands after their exposure to the serpentfolk's wicked ways. Among the dozens of fiendish icons was Moxix, who came into inf luence among the cyclopes as their practice of sacrifice and cannibalism increased. It was at this time Moxix became known as the Drinker of Human Hopes. The ancient Ghol-Gan cyclopes fed him hundreds of captured humans, most of whom were of Azlanti descent. In one instance early in his time among the Ghol-Gan cyclopes, Moxix's followers captured an entire Azlanti embassy and fed them to the strange demon one by one while their companions watched in horror. Some say the sacrifices' spirits still inhabit the region, their wailing cries drifting through the hills and jungles of the haunted island. As his reign of blood began to spread from its base in southern Ghol-Gan, a raging contingent of rival cyclopes from elsewhere in the failing empire raided the demon-worshiping clan dedicated to Moxix, bringing both brute strength and the magic of powerful shamans and oracles to bear against it. The battle raged for 2 days, and in the end an oracle sacrificed her life in a final ploy to destroy Moxix. However, the oracle only succeeded in binding him to the high mountain peak that would one day become the island known as Yoha's Graveyard. To this very day, Moxix remains trapped in his island domain, ever eager to draw creatures to the ziggurat he calls home. There he delights in turning people to cannibalism, destruction, and insanity. Obscuring and disease-laden mists swirl around the island, keeping its lands hidden and protected from trespassers. Once per year, however, on the first full moon after the rainy season, the mists part for a single night. Some explorers have mounted expeditions to Moxix's island during these events, but as of yet, no one has returned the same person she used to be; all bear the mark of insanity Moxix stamps on their being.",

The smallest of mu spores (such as the one presented here) are never less than a hundred feet long from tentacle tip to tentacle tip, and weigh a minimum of 200,000 pounds. Yet despite their vast bulk, mu spores are capable of flying with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide their flight through the air. Mu spores dwell in vast caverns, but sometimes drift up to the surface through immense pits or tunnels-they have no fear of sunlight, but prefer nocturnal habits. Mu spores are more than just ravenous eaters of nations-they possess uncommon intellects, and if peaceful contact can be made, their knowledge can be quite valuable. Even more valuable, to many debased alchemists, are the strange secretions and spores they emit, for these rare materials can be brewed into the strangest of drugs and elixirs.",

      "description": "False gods, fallen demagogues, nemesis devils-all are names for the fiends known collectively as advodazas. They survive from dark ages past, when mortals offered worship to base things and unwholesome spirits that masqueraded as baleful gods. Although time and faith have turned against these beings, the most tenacious of their kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors and one-time deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to restore their power and lordship over mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are shades of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, and fiends of blasphemy: the idol-clad advodazas. Fantastically ancient beings, advodazas rose from spirits worshiped by mortals in distant ages, typically as part of primitive and deranged cults. While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters, begging any power that would listen to protect them from storms, beasts, enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the land, sky, and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive inf luences, these forces heard the early prayers and worked what appeared to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly, these formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladia, and all manner of cult images. Yet as knowledge of true deities and the powers they offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were either forgotten or demonized and rooted out. All advodazas desire to eventually return to the Material Plane, where they might tempt new followers to serve, sacrifice, and raise idols to their names. Though merciless, advodazas appeal to many mortals because of the directness of their interaction and their willingness to grant power or to violently smite enemies for a seemingly paltry price. In death, however, advodazas' servants find no divine realm, nor do they sit beside some grand deity. When they die, there is only Hell. No two advodazas look exactly alike. Each one embodies the powers and spheres of influence for which it was worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal and half-bestial shapes that bristle with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith-in the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons-and bristle with archaic power and unquenchable arrogance. Despite this wide range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess augmented or even unique abilities. Most advodazas stand about 18 feet tall and weigh approximately 9 tons.",

      "description": "Even today, centuries after his 13th and final execution, memories of Riktus Scroon continue to haunt the nightmares of those who live along the northern coastlines of the Inner Sea. During his reign of horror, the man who would come to be known as the Nightripper used his position in the now disbanded Graven Guard of Taldor to move along the shipping lanes with ease. His position among the mercenary company afforded him time in countless settlements from Golisfar to Corentyn, and in these unsuspecting towns he hunted. Scroon preferred young victims, that their vanishing would cause the most distress possible-his favorites were young adults freshly in love, although he seemed to have had no preference between man or woman. He abducted his victims with astonishing skill, tormenting them for hours with his blades before leaving them broken and bleeding to death at the bottom of a specially prepared pit far outside of town. The mass murderer was finally captured by Cesandra Dayne, an obsessed priest of Sarenrae who had lost her fiancee and her father to Scroon. Only by forsaking the teachings of her church was she able to trap the murderer in the slums of Almas, and although the resulting fight saw the death of a dozen innocent bystanders, in the end Cesandra had her man alive. After Scroon was turned over to the law in his hometown of Oppara, the authorities thought to prosecute him for the deaths of no fewer than 46 known victims. When Scroon gleefully bragged of having murdered nearly a thousand men, women, and children, the authorities were eager to write off his ravings, yet after Scroon provided exacting details to the sites of 953 victims, and one after the other his directions led to actual graves, the killer's sentencing was hastened-death by hanging. Yet Scroon survived. One after the other, attempts to execute the Nightripper failed-headsmen died of fright as they lifted the axe, guillotines malfunctioned, magic failed. Each botched execution left Scroon more disfigured, but his legend grew. The 13th and final execution put the man down once and for all-or so it was hoped. Scroon's soul went to the Boneyard, where something amazing happened-he passed through to the Abyss with his mind and memories intact. So remarkable was his retention of his identity that it drew the attention of Lamashtu herself, who pulled the killer's soul from the shuddersome bosom of the Abyss and made him her personal assassin, raising him from a broken shell of a soul to a nascent demon lord with greater power than he'd ever hoped for in life. His form had changed, transforming into a shape more befitting one of his horrific nature, yet his mind remained sharp and clear. Nightripper harbors a strong desire for revenge, but for now he serves dutifully as Lamashtu's favored torturer and assassin and as the lord of the dungeons below her palace in the Abyssal realm of Kurnugia. But it is said that someday, when he has repaid his debt to the Mother of Demons for his ascension and rescue from the dregs of the Abyss, the Nightripper will return to his old haunts. Only this time, it will not be individuals he breaks and bleeds and buries in his pits-it will be entire cities.",

It cannot be resurrected or otherwise restored to life until the curse is lifted. While the curse remains in effect, the victim takes 1d4 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain every day as any lingering shreds of sanity are blasted away. When each ability score is drained to zero, the DC of the curse increases by +4. A character suffering the curse of living death can remain in this state forever, but as long as any one of her mental ability scores is at zero, she is capable only of enduring pain and cannot observe the world around her. Even if the character's body is destroyed, the cursed victim's consciousness remains as a disembodied and invisible presence at the site of this destruction, and cannot be resurrected or released to the afterlife.

This is not to say that the nightwalker never sacrifices its troops to gain a tactical advantage-just that these attacks are the only ones the monster feels no urge to participate in directly.

Worshiped as gods by some, the norns do little to discourage this veneration. A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.",

When an obcisidaemon successfully captures a soul with its inherit soul ability, the soul becomes a part of its cloak of souls, taking up one soul slot. An obcisidaemon has a number of soul slots equal to its Charisma modifier (usually 7). An obcisidaemon can consume a soul as a swift action to achieve a particular effect. When a soul within this cloak is consumed by the obcisidaemon, it is immolated as though by the destruction spell. Destroying the daemon frees the souls in its cloak, though this does not return the deceased creatures to life. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a cloak of souls requires a DC 28 caster level check. Failure results in the spell having no effect, while success tears the victim's soul free from the cloak and returns the creature to life as normal. If the daemon is in an unholy location, such as that created by the unhallow spell, the DC of this caster level check increases by +2. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based. An obcisidaemon can achieve one of the following effects by consuming a single soul. <ul><li> Increase the DC of the next spell-like ability the obcisidaemon uses that round by +1. <li> Give the obcisidaemon 3d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour. <li> Increase the damage of the obcisidaemon's next melee attack that round by +1d6 hit points. </li></li></li></ul>",

Obcisidaemons strip away the veneer of honor and battlefield glory, leaving only the brutal and violent pragmatism at its core, and then divest it of any humanity to reveal naught but scorched earth and genocide. Ref lecting the disgraceful values of ethnic cleansing, depopulation, and all other forms of the clinical, systematic obliteration of civilian populations, obcisidaemons are among the most powerful members of daemonkind. These paragons of inhumanity arrive in the heart of great cities and leave only wastelands of rubble and ashes in their wake.

Such individuals rarely have trouble managing the unforgiving wastes, as they are willing to destroy any and all possible allies in order to ensure their own survival, making betrayal an impossibility and solitude an inevitability. This vicious soul eventually develops into an obcisidaemon-a lone, wandering mass of slaughter that acts as a harbinger of undiscriminating and unforgiving death to all who dare stand in its path. In life, the soul of an obcisidaemon perhaps only desired to kill a particular chosen population; as an obcisidaemon, however, the being seeks the obliteration of all mortals. Peculiar to an obcisidaemon is the cloak of souls that seems to drip from its enormous body, a symbol of its destructive abilities that provides onlookers an idea as to the sheer scope of its murderous capabilities. When an obcisidaemon lays slaughter to entire populations, it does not feast on all of the souls at once, instead capturing victims for later use. When the fiend needs to unleash a particularly potent rampage upon a resistant population, it consumes its reserve souls in order to strengthen its powers and ensure its success in total annihilation.",

Sometimes, an amassed group of obcisidaemons instead trails behind an invading daemonic army, so as to ensure that no trace of the butchered mortals remains but ashes and salted earth. Obcisidaemons not only ensure that all life perishes, but that the land is thereafter uninhabitable by any other creatures as well. Occasionally, an obcisidaemon serves Apollyon, occupying a similar role at the head of a titanic flight of leukodaemons, sowing disease and clouds of poison across miles of terrain in its passing. Some obcisidaemons serve no particular member of the Four, instead choosing to function as independent agents of genocide. These beings wander from plane to plane, laying waste to one civilization after another. Some obcisidaemons intentionally spread their true names to the Material Plane, hoping for a foolish evil summoner to call upon them, knowing that no mere mortal could control their awesome power. Most such summoners end up among the first souls devoured and consumed into the cloud of tormented spirits that cloaks the now-rampaging obcisidaemon.",

As a standard action, an olethrodaemon that begins its turn with an opponent grappled in either of its mouths can swallow the opponent by succeeding on another grapple check. If successful, the creature is swallowed into one of the olethrodaemon's many stomachs. These stomachs grind their contents and drain the life force from living creatures. Every round a creature remains in an olethrodaemon's stomach, it takes 4d8+18 points of damage and gains 1d4 negative levels. The creature can attempt to cut its way out of the olethrodaemon's stomach, but it suffers the chance of just cutting into another stomach chamber. An olethrodaemon's stomach is AC 20 and has 40 hit points. Once a creature deals enough damage to allow escape, it has a 50% chance to end up in another stomach chamber instead of escaping. Due to the multiple stomach chambers, an olethrodaemon can house and drain up to four medium creatures at one time. This ability otherwise functions as the swallow whole special attack. It is a DC 33 Fortitude save to remove negative levels gained in this fashion. This save is Constitution-based. Soul-Drained Breath (Su) An olethrodaemon can convert life energy it has consumed into a potent breath weapon. Up to three times per day, but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, an olethrodaemon can expel a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone of shrieking black smoke and wind from one of its mouths as a standard action. Any living creature in the area of this attack takes 20d10 points of damage from negative energy, or half on a successful DC 27 Reflex save. Undead creatures caught in this negative energy are healed for the same amount instead of damaged. The save DC for this effect is Charisma-based.<br>While some of the more powerful daemons are servitors to one of the Four Horsemen, olethrodaemons serve as juggernauts for all of the Four. These massive creatures are the embodiment of death and destruction-the very vessels of apocalypse that daemons wish to see wrought upon the multiverse. These nihilistic behemoths roam the gray expanses of Abaddon, feasting on the souls of evil mortals damned to their realm. When on the Material Plane, olethrodaemons act as agents of destruction, spreading ruin and devouring mortal souls as they plow through cities and countrysides, bent on devastation. It's rare for a mortal to be able to control such a potent force, but sometimes mad spellcasters utilize effects like gate to urge an olethrodaemon to visit a devastating holocaust upon an enemy region-the olethrodaemon generally does not hold a grudge against a mortal that asks such a service from it. These immense creatures stand over 25 feet tall and weigh close to 12,000 pounds, their powerful, muscular bodies covered by durable plates and head thronged with dangerous, twisted horns. Olethrodaemons stand on four stout legs, and possess an equal number of arms, each ending in wickedly sharp claws able to tear through stone as easily as flesh. The creature's eyes, as well as its two mouths, glow like coals in a kiln. The creature feeds on souls and has multiple stomachs to digest mortal essences. While not as intelligent or scheming as many other powerful daemons (or other fiends who match their power, for that matter), olethrodaemons remain dangerous foes. They do not generally wish to lead armies and gain power by control, but rather to revel in the evil purity of annihilation. Among olethrodaemons, the greatest desire is to be the one to devour the very last mortal soul. They angle and shove for this honor, often ceding a city or group of victims to a rival if they believe that, in so doing, they might gain the advantage of positioning to consume the final soul once the multiverse has been devoured. <br/></br>",

These creatures are known as paragons, and gain this level of power by pledging their loyalty to one of the Four Horsemen as a chosen agent of apocalypse. These advanced olethrodaemons specialize in their patron's particular method of annihilation, their abilities evolving to suit the method of ruin. An olethrodaemon paragon generally has from 4 to 8 additional Hit Dice, and is usually a CR 22 to CR 24 creature. Some planar scholars postulate that olethrodaemons are actually the creations of the Four Horsemen, and that the Four worked foul rites upon a fifth Horseman, with these interactions spawning olethrodaemons to serve their will and spread oblivion throughout the multiverse. The abilities of these chosen spawn warp to the tendencies of their daemonic lords. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of Pestilence can infect their victims with a powerful disease by means of all their natural attacks. Creatures who succumb to this attack are affected as if by a maximized contagion spell, heightened to 9th level. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of War can imbue their natural attacks with additional properties. As a free action, an olethrodaemon can apply any special weapon property equivalent to a +2 enhancement to its bite, claw, gore, or trample attacks for 1 round-most of these olethrodaemon paragons elect to grant their natural weapons the unholy enhancement. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of Famine gain the consumptive aura ability of the meladaemon, but the nonlethal damage dealt increases to 6d6 and victims who succumb become exhausted rather than merely fatigued. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of Death gain the ability to inf lict a negative level on a foe each time they strike with a claw attack, or else gain the ability to cause those they damage to age rapidly and grow old and frail with hideous speed.</br>",

In other instances, phasmadaemons are merely among the most fearful of the hunted souls of Abaddon, souls who eventually learn to exult in the terror they feel as a soul-devouring daemon stalks them; eventually, these vile souls may transform from the hunted into the hunters-daemons seeking the thrill of the hunt for the horror-stricken faces of their prey. Whether in the chasms of Abaddon or on other planes, phasmadaemons hunt for souls via stealth, following from a distance to study their prey for prolonged periods. They create elaborate illusions, leading their targets into believing in entire fictional environments and creatures, all dependent on the victims' most feared imaginings. They extract each soul's intrinsic, underlying fears, using the figments as weapons against their owners. Phasmadaemons do not seek souls that are merely easy prey-they adhere strictly to their own method of destroying souls, reveling in the grotesque pleasure of striking mortal souls dead with fear-induced heart attacks and other physical maladies. The connection between fear and mortality is something that continually fascinates the morbid curiosities of phasmadaemons, who mix fears like alchemists, conducting experiments and concocting ever more terrifying combinations of horrific imaginings.",

            "description": "Phasmadaemons tend to hunt alone, preferring to develop their own unique styles of torment and horror to unleash upon their victims. While some would suggest that the freakishly complex traps of crucidaemons or the cocooned feeding of sangudaemons rank as the most dreadful and frightening killing tactics among daemonkind, the terrors manifested by phasmadaemons exceed them both. A phasmadaemon extracts a mortal's own fears and turns the figments against their creator, not enjoying the torment the horrors induce so much as appreciating the effects of fear within its victim before the thing's last fatal gasp-the tiny hairs standing upright, the racing heart, jerking muscles, paralysis. Such reactions spawn immense pleasure within a phasmadaemon, which continually seeks ways to fill its victims with dread. Among phasmadaemons, the buying and selling of fears is in itself something of a market, much like the economy of souls within the rest of Abaddon. The fiends exchange their own horrific new imaginings with one another, creating a collection of terrors unfathomable by mortals. Phasmadaemons do not often serve a single Horseman exclusively, their skills not necessarily a boon to any particular facet of death. They tend to traverse the outskirts of societies both within Abaddon and outside of it, preying on travelers in the dead of winter nights or seeking out hermits in order to haunt their isolated homes. The tension before the kill is almost as thrilling to a phasmadaemon as the kill itself, and the foul beings wallow in the fear they create before swooping in for the final blow. When they travel in groups, phasmadaemons use their powers to create great multitudes of illusionary images in order to terrorize entire groups or crowds of closely situated people, such as causing heart-stopping incidents in the middle of a playhouse's performance, situating horrific conjurations in the middle of packed bazaars, and positioning frightful images at the gallows at a crowded execution.",

The save DC is Constitution-based.<br/>Rulers of infernal realms, generals of Hell's armies, and advisors to the archf iends, pit fiends embody the awesome and terrible pinnacle of devilkind. Massive, physically indomitable, and possessed of ingenious evil intellects, these diabolical tyrants hold great autonomy whether in their service to the archf iends, in their rule of vast infernal fiefdoms, or in subjugation of mortal worlds. Thick muscles cling to their gigantic frames, armored over by dense, bladed scales capable of def lecting all but the most potent assaults. Fangs as thick as daggers fill their maws, bestial visages disguising some of the most insidious minds in Hell.Born within the depths of Nessus, the ninth and deepest layer of Hell, pit fiends are raised from the ranks of cornugons and gelugons by the archdevils and their dukes alone. While many travel to higher layers and far from Hell to command infernal legions, most remain in Nessus serving in the courts of Hell's elite or in dark councils with unknowable purposes. Pit fiends always stand over 14 feet tall, with wingspans in excess of 20 feet and weights over 1,000 pounds.Pit fiends are masters of fire and prefer lands bathed in flame. In Hell, this predisposes them to Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon the layers most likely to harbor their burning temple-citadels. Fanatics obsessed with diabolical superiority and ironclad obedience, pit fiends left to their own devices raise massive armies, scouring the pits of Hell for the most depraved lemures to transform into true fiends. When convinced they've formed the perfect legions, they turn their attentions to vulnerable demiplanes and mortal worlds, eyeing them for infernal domination and the glory of conquest. In the service of the archfiends or other unique infernal warlords, pit fiends hold themselves to a greater cause, obeying the wills of Asmodeus's chosen nobles in the hopes of one day garnering the favor of either the Prince of Darkness or Hell itself. While obedient to the hierarchies of their kind, they are also strict in their enforcement, and should a pit fiend find itself subservient to a master unfit to rule, it holds itself duty bound to cast down such an incompetent lord. Thus, whether as masters or servants, pit fiends embody the will of Hell's merciless law and assure that only the strongest of devilkind flourish (or dare to).Only the most powerful of mortal spellcasters can or dare summon a pit fiend. These devils' reactions to summoning are deliberate and swift, usually typified by overwhelming rage that such insignificant beings would waste their immortal time. Those that cannot weather the devils' burning rage are slain-their souls typically racing the pit fiends back to Hell. Those who manage to keep control of the greater devils, though, intrigue them. A pit fiend might dutifully serve a mortal master for centuries, but its goal is always the same: to further corrupt the mortal soul, assure its absolute damnation, and when the mortal inevitably dies, claim its soul and begin the process of creating a perfectly corrupt lemure servant.Pit fiends know they are immortal and are intelligent enough to indulge in impossibly disciplined patience.As such, the eldest pit fiends see in their legions the faces of countless fools who once presumed themselves the devils' masters.",

While their origin is not fully known, it is widely accepted that plasma oozes are not from this world. Some scholars believe they dwell in the sun, while others maintain they hail from the Plane of Fire. That plasma oozes have been encountered in both of these locations does little to help solve the debate. A plasma ooze flies by somehow interacting with gravity and magnetic waves, drifting through the air in a manner similar to the way a jellyfish swims in water. This creature's only real purpose is to consume, and it prefers to do so by drawing prey into its fiery, electrified core. Scholars find it curious that while a plasma ooze can only attract and repel metallic substances, the thing can only digest organic matter, and rather slowly at that. Survivors of plasma ooze attacks are rare, but such victims describe the pain of being struck by one's rays as like being pulled apart piece by piece. Wounds left by a plasma ooze's touch resemble hideously melted burn scars. A plasma ooze is 20 feet in diameter and weighs 6,000 pounds.",

      "description": "The pleroma is the most powerful of all the aeons. As a manifestation of the opposing acts of creation and destruction, a pleroma exists in a state of flux, its very form shifting between creation and oblivion within the ebon folds of its vaporous cloak. One who gazes upon a pleroma could spend days studying the continual changes of its form, which most resemble the shifting of celestial bodies within the universe sped up to a pace at which the swirling of galaxies and the tumble of planets form a strange dance. Pleromas view the concepts of creation and oblivion not so much as separate processes, but rather as two parts of a cyclical passage that everything in existence must explore. Pleromas guide this progression, ensuring everything remains balanced, such that whatever is created can be destroyed, and that nothing becomes so static that these two processes slow to a halt. For everything that attains a state of semi-permanence, there must be many more things that do not, or rather that cannot ever be reformed into a state of permanence. While pleromas believe in eternity, they understand that eternity is cyclical and infinity is something that repeats itself. Therefore, eternity and infinity are states that can be changed, or altered, if only slightly. Pleromas maintain such changes are necessary to keep the cosmos from becoming static and unbalanced, a state they refer to as apocalypse, or the end of everything. Of all the aeons, pleromas possess the strongest connection to the entity or concept they refer to as Monad. All aeons believe themselves to be extensions of this entity, and while they act freely and independently of the entity, they always act within the constricts of its will or needs. This behavior is not so much a state of servitude as a symbiosis in which the actions of the pleromas are universally beneficial to both themselves and the entity they are part of. Pleromas describe Monad as the sentience of the multiverse, from which all things are created through the recycling of everything that ever existed. Pleromas typically travel alone. Their arrival in a region almost always heralds some sort of dramatic change. They pay little mind to the wants and needs of other creatures, and remain entirely focused upon their primary task. They avoid conf licts of ethics, wars, and similar pursuits, save when manipulating such events would help to restore the balance between creation and oblivion. Should any be so foolish as to attempt to interfere with or sway their work, pleromas immediately retaliate by bringing all of their significant powers and devastating abilities to bear until the intervention is destroyed.",

A purrodaemon can have up to a dozen weapons lodged in its body at a time, but only one can possess magical enhancements at a time. The total enhancements cannot exceed a +4 effective enhancement-most purrodaemons opt to create +2 wounding weapons in this manner. A weapon's enhancements vanish as soon as the purrodaemon dies or releases the weapon.

A sard can pass for an old dead tree-especially when the creature uses its tree shape spell-like ability. Yet despite its enormous size and ungainly shape, the sard is in fact a swift and agile monster. It can move with unsettling grace and speed, crawling across the ground on long spidery roots like an immense insect. It attacks either with a single slam of its immense trunk or by launching volleys of foot-long thorns that inject the creature's poisonous, electrified sap. Sards are nearly as intelligent as most humans, but few actually use this intelligence for productive purposes-the first sards were created as a form of living siege engine, and they quite enjoy this destructive role, often seeking out fortresses or even towns to systematically destroy.",

Conf licting tales of her origins abound, from demonic flesh-crafting and arcane experiments to a divine curse handed down by a vengeful deity. The most popular stories cast the first scylla as the monstrous spawn of a union between a mortal and a god. Whatever the case, scyllas are fortunately quite rare, enough so that many consider them nothing more than tall tales told by sailors deep in their cups. Scyllas dwell along major shipping lanes, often near coastlines, where they use their spell-like abilities to lure entire ships to their doom. The hideous monsters are intelligent creatures, though half-mad with hunger and self-loathing. They normally do not use weapons, but when they do, they prefer to fight with light weapons wielded by their human-sized upper arms. However, they much prefer to keep their hands free to utilize magic items like wands, staves, and other powerful devices.",

      "description": "Shaggy demodands are obese outsiders that occupy the highest status within demodand society. The fleshy tyrants stand just under 7 feet tall and have huge bat wings capable of supporting their 600-pound weight. Their faces have the broad-set eyes of a toad and toothy underbites. Although they still answer to their titanic masters, shaggy demodands are the masters of their kind, and serve the thanatotic titans as advisors, covert agents, or battlefield generals. In the Abyss, shaggy demodands command great armies, leading them against demonic hordes as the balance of Abyssal power ebbs and flows. Often underestimated due to their shape, these demodands are both intelligent and cunning, and approach battle with an effective mixture of strategy and ruthless detachment.",

      "description": "Shamira, the Ardent Dream, is the nominal ruler of the isle of Alinythia, and by extension the city of Alushinyrra, but with the honor of ruling the largest of the Midnight Isles comes with an unwritten caveat-Nocticula's palace overlooks the city from its own isle. While this position is one that Shamira revels in, and one that has afforded her no small amount of inf luence (indeed, it's helped to propel her into the ranks of nascent demon lords), the Ardent Dream knows that her mistress watches over her always, and surely regards her not only as a valued lover, companion, and minion, but also as the closest thing Nocticula has to competition. Of course, Shamira does keep an eye out for any opportunity she has to erode some of Nocticula's power, for someday she hopes to wear Nocticula's crown. Shamira is unique in her appearance. Even before she became a nascent demon lord, her burning wings and flowing crimson hair marked her as a succubus of power. Close-lipped about her history, she appeared in Nocticula's palace one moonrise and seduced the Lady in Shadow, thus earning the position of Lady of Alinythia. (Nocticula banished Shamira's predecessor, an incubus named Ziforian, to the sewers below the city, where he may yet lurk.) None in the Abyss recall this majestic and unmistakable succubus in the city before her arrival in Nocticula's boudoir. Shamira does little to quell rumors that her previous home was a much loftier place than the Abyss, and her resemblance to the deity Sarenrae provides endless speculation.",

Although they don't require sustenance, shemhazians take perverse delight in mutilating and eating their victims.A shemhazian stands 35 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds. They form from the sinful souls of torturers and those who enjoyed mutilating living victims to death.",

      "description": "Although even lunatics and doom-saying prophets desperately claim the monstrous shoggoth is nothing more than a drug-induced vision or thankfully unreal nightmare, the truth is altogether more dire. The shoggoths exist, although they keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of forgotten caverns and ruins, emerging only rarely to spread madness and destruction in their slime-caked wakes.The first shoggoths were created in eons past, long before the first gods turned their attentions to the Material Plane. Some hold that the aboleths engineered them, while certain strange texts hint of a race even older that engineered the first shoggoths as slaves. Eventually, these dread beasts developed enough intelligence to rebel against their creators, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deep.",

The city itself is constantly destroying itself, as its buildings continually plummet into the churning surf along an eternally crumbling coastline. Sifkesh is among the most enigmatic of all demon lords, for she seems more diabolic or even daemonic in her personality and appearance. Planar scholars have long struggled to interpret the demon lord's position and power. The belief that Sifkesh rose from the animus of a heretical erinyes who became the first of Hell's heretics is correct, and she constantly works to seduce and lure additional powerful devils from their infernal roles, inviting some to join her as favored minions but leaving others in place so they can more easily work to subvert Hell's machinations. <br/></br>",

Worship of Sifkesh is a deeply personal and secretive thing, and many of her followers publicly belong to other religions, worshiping the demon lord of heresy in secret as they work to undermine the faith their allies and companions believe them to have. Holy sites to Sifkesh include desecrated churches, haunted houses, and towers with too many windows-nearly always, such temples and shrines to Sifkesh are empty and abandoned. The lone worshiper might share the site with other creatures such as predators or undead, and may even rely upon the presence of such creatures as convenient protection and defense against the enemy. Sifkesh's unholy symbol is a pair of feminine hands crossed at slashed wrists. Her favored weapon is the war razor (The Inner Sea World Guide 290-291). She grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Madness, and Trickery, and to the subdomains of Deception, Demon, Loss, and Nightmare (even though she normally wouldn't be able to grant access to the subdomain of Loss, she can do so due to her close associations with despair and hopelessness).</br>",

Slimy demodands often serve as shock troops in demodand armies, but they are also frequently put in charge of gathering and keeping slaves. Slimy demodands have no magical mind control powers, but prefer to rely upon intimidation and physical threats anyway to manage their slaves and keep them in line.",

      "description": "Solars are the greatest type of angel, usually serving at the right hand of a deity or championing a cause that benefits an entire world or plane. A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin. Blessed with an array of magical powers and the spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar's hand. Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter. In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be. Though they are not gods, the solars' power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities-never without the deity's approval-or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities (which they may be, depending on the deity). Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been \"promoted\" to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods' first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or destruction of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil. Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of halfcelestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals' proximity to celestial energy. Actual offspring are rare, and when they occur, it is always a mortal mother that bears the child-while solars can appear as either sex, the gods have not granted them the capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities. Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and mysterious ways. All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, acting as great field marshals for massive incursions against the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss.",

Their abilities and defenses make them singularly adept at handling the alien threats and strange constructs that lurk in this realm, and as a result, spine dragons have become one of Numeria's most successful predators.Of course, a spine dragon is much more than a predator. As with many true dragons, spine dragons are particularly vain and enjoy being groveled to. It's not uncommon for them to assume the role of god for ignorant tribes of giants. They also have a particular love of crystalline treasure and magic items-a spine dragon's horde is usually sparse on the classic \"carpet of coins\" but just as valuable overall in content as those of true dragons.A spine dragon is 60 feet long and 20 feet high, and weighs 16,000 pounds.",

      "description": "Of all the strange and malefic denizens of the void between the stars, few cause the same terror as this titanic race. They hail from a mad star whose light cannot be seen by conventional telescopes, and the smallest of these behemoths stand nearly 30 feet in height. Humanoid in shape, their immense bodies have rubbery flesh that seems to wriggle and seethe like a half-solidified ooze. Tremendous draconic wings, murderous taloned hands, and a tentacled visage that evokes the alien gaze of an octopus complete the being's monstrous shape. This malevolent race has a name, yet it is no name known to the sane. Among mortal scholars, they are known merely by the name of their greatest priest-they are the star-spawn of Cthulhu. The star-spawn of Cthulhu have a strange, mutable anatomy-their form is not fixed. They can absorb parts of their bodies or enlarge others at will, a trait they often use on their claws or tentacles to dramatically extend their reach in combat beyond what might normally be possible for a creature of the same shape and size. Despite this mutable shape, the star-spawn's forms generally don't deviate far from that of an octopus-headed, winged humanoid, likely because of the powerful links their otherworldly minds have to their overlord and master, who lies dead but dreaming in the lost city of R'lyeh. Although they typically appear as immense humanoid creatures with rubbery hides and octopoid heads, the star-spawn of Cthulhu are not any more aquatic in nature than they are terrestrial-that they're often associated with a planet's oceans lies more in the simple fact that oceans often cover the majority of a planet's surface. The creatures themselves, being equally at home on land, at sea, or in the depths of space, make no real distinction between such regions, choosing them as the sites of their cities and temples for purposes only they can know. Servants of the alien gods of the void, they work upon the worlds they invade to wipe them clean of indigenous life in preparation for the eventual time when the deep void expands to replace all that exists with its strange realities. The star-spawn of Cthulhu hold little malice toward indigenous life-they simply can't proceed with their plans for a world while such life exists. Just as a human might move into a house thinking it to be abandoned, only to discover colonies of ants dwelling within the building's walls, the star-spawn work to eradicate indigenous infestations. Their methods seldom vary from world to world-those whose intellects they can inf luence via dreams and nightmares they besiege as the victims sleep, seeding the growth of destructive cults and societies. These groups in turn further the star-spawn's agenda, preparing the world and bringing it to the brink of destruction. When such worlds are poised to tear themselves apart from within through unrest, civil war, excessive pollution, or genocide, the star-spawn mobilize their cults to end all things. The only reward such cults may receive for their (sometimes unwitting) aid is the dubious honor of being among the final few to be eradicated, for the star-spawn have no interest in and feel no responsibility toward their pawns. The fact that the star-spawn's plans to bring about the eradication of life span centuries or even millennia should not be mistaken for sloth or lassitude-the star-spawn are inhumanly patient, and the preparation of the universe's worlds must precisely follow an unknowable schedule, for only when the exact cosmic convergences are in place and the stars are right can they make their final moves to end all things. This time frame does give some worlds a chance to discover the star-spawn's inf luence and to delay or even defeat their world's star-spawned doom, but such tales of triumph are rare in the face of the void's relentless tides. The star-spawn of Cthulhu war with many other strange races out of time and space, including elder things (see page 85) and the servitors of other Great Old Ones (see page 135). They have also been known to use these creatures-and other races such as the mi-go-as pawns, slaves, or minions to promote their immortal agenda. Though the star-spawn themselves hail from a distant world deep in the void and can be found on countless other realms as gods and monsters, their lord Cthulhu (see page 138) dwells upon a distant planet far removed from any commonly visited world. Yet while Cthulhu lies imprisoned in the corpse-city of R'lyeh deep under a great ocean, his dreams resonate still in the minds of his star-spawn, and from there touch upon the dreams of many slumbering poets and philosophers on countless worlds. Guided by their knowledge of their master's great plan, and updated by his far-reaching dreams, the star-spawn of Cthulhu proceed inevitably toward their goals.",

Taiga linnorms take down foes and prey first with their electrifying breath and finish their victims off with their devastating bite. In winter, when light is sparse and the nights are long, it is easy for a taiga linnorm to blend in with the coniferous forests it dwells in, hiding among the trees and ambushing imprudent travelers or unwary adventurers setting up camp. A taiga linnorm often lies in wait for days- sometimes weeks-just for the opportunity to maim and devour unsuspecting victims. When this subtler tactic does not work, a taiga linnorm simply rampages through the woods in order to find nearby settlements to pillage, taking twisted delight in shocking the inhabitants before shredding them with its massive jaws or destructive forelimbs. In any event, taiga linnorms rarely venture far from their woodland territories save for short flights to attack outlying villages. A taiga linnorm is 50 feet long and weighs just over 13,000 pounds.",

Serene in their immortality, tempest behemoths fear no other being. As living forces of divine retribution, tempest behemoths are sent forth into the world to raze far-f lung cities, ravage towns with mighty storms, level remote mountain temples, and tear apart siege fortresses impregnable from the ground. The advent of a tempest behemoth is generally presaged by foul weather and terrific storms that drive flocks of birds before their headwinds. The day before the behemoth arrives, the storms suddenly abate-ironically encouraging victims to emerge into the open just as the behemoth strikes.",

      "description": "Sent by the gods to punish those who dwell near the sea, thalassic behemoths scourge ships and other vessels from the waters before turning their attention toward structures and survivors on land. Despite their massive bulk, thalassic behemoths swim incredibly fast and can easily outpace all but the fleetest of ships. On land, they can be more readily escaped, at least by those willing and able to leave homes and belongings behind. Though capable of surviving indefinitely on land and employing a clumsy, seal-like locomotion, thalassic behemoths soon weary of gravity's never-ending drag. They rarely venture more than a mile or two from shore before returning to the comforting buoyancy of the seas. Thalassic behemoths resemble immense sperm whales in the water, but they can quickly haul themselves ashore using their mighty forelimbs. Tail and limb alike shatter wood and stone with but a single blow, while their jaws gape wide enough to swallow smaller boats whole. The coming of a thalassic behemoth is typically foreshadowed by a dramatic increase in missing ships, strange tides, and the uncanny sight of sea life purposefully beaching upon shores. Thalassic behemoths generally spend much of their time lurking a few hundred feet below the surface-but legends hold that even greater behemoths, the dread leviathans, dwell in the deepest oceanic reaches.",

After they were betrayed to the gods by their own kin, the Thanatotic titans were banished into the Abyss. Today, they seethe with jealousy that their Elysian kin are allowed to wander the planes at will, while they can leave their Abyssal realm only by stealth. Now, these powerful outsiders spend much of their time brooding, fighting among themselves, and waging war for control of Abyssal realms against the legions of various demon lords. Thanatotic titans see themselves as the true icons worthy of worship. Some work to found personal cults among mortals, while others simply wage unending crusades against the minions of the gods.",

Viewed by her children as a benevolent matriarch rather than a mother, the thriae queen is the only fertile member of the colony, and thus the sole reproducer should the colony's population meet a devastating blow, whether through plague, famine, or war. A queen is revered by soldiers and seers alike, both for her physical might and her divine power, and she exemplifies the very best of thriae society in terms of strength, insight, and magnetism. While a queen is often too busy to entertain guests of a thriae hive, those intruders who do catch a glimpse of her are captured by her beauty and grace, and many would follow her if only to be by her side. But those who are allowed to enjoy the queen's company are few, and those few are carefully selected from among the hive's greatest warriors and priestesses, soldiers and seers whose powers have shown them to be skillful as well as loyal. Most thriae colonies only have one queen, though particularly large or far-reaching hives have been known to have as many as three at any given time. Thriae queens are the ultimate authority within a hive, and make most of the major decisions regarding the colony's growth. Only the wealthiest and most respected outsiders are granted an audience with the ever-busy queen, whose numerous duties around the hive are analogous to those of any other ruler of a small kingdom. They grant only audiences regarding matters of the utmost concern, matters that stimulate the curiosity of a thriae queen and require not merely the cryptic readings of seers but a true divination as only a queen can provide. When not divining or performing governmental tasks, a thriae queen can often be found in her private chamber, where she lies with male consorts, lays eggs, cares for her larvae, and creates the vast stores of merope used every day within the hive. Consorts are chosen carefully, as they are constantly within extremely close proximity to the queen, who is far from vulnerable in her own right but nonetheless often prefers to avoid conf licts with would-be assassins or burglars. A thriae queen lays fertilized eggs in one of the waxy, golden cells of her chamber walls. Thriae eggs go through several stages of growth before becoming fully formed thriae-the longest stage of development is the larval stage, which is a crucial point in determining the formation of a thriae. Most larvae are fed merope while they grow, but in the height of her power, a thriae queen selects a single larva to be her successor, and she feeds that individual a special substance secreted from her merope gland called royal merope. This thick, jellylike substance strengthens the larva and causes it to grow greatly in size, and when it pupates and hatches, it does so as a fully grown thriae queen. The mother queen teaches its successor in the ways of divining as well as ruling a colony. The successor then faces a choice-either remaining in the colony she was born into and furthering the growth of the hive, or setting out on her own to establish an allied colony. If she does the latter, the remaining queen must birth another successor, which is not considered so much a bother as it is an unavoidable circumstance. Queens do not look upon successors who leave as deserting daughters, instead viewing them as future allies for the colony down the road. <br/>",

They indiscriminately gorge their five seemingly bottomless stomachs on forests and jungles, collapse mine and mountain alike in search of ore, and raze settlements and strongholds for the cowering morsels within. Thunder behemoths are sent out by the gods to destroy wicked cities, raze great temples or monuments that offend divine eyes, and otherwise act as instruments of divine wrath either on the surface of a world or just below it. The days before a thunder behemoth arrives are fraught with minor but unnerving earthquakes, mass exoduses of burrowing animals to the surface, and an unexplained increase in fallen trees and sinkholes.",

This condition persists as long as the creature remains within Treerazer's aura of corruption and for 1 minute thereafter. While suffering the effects of this aura, the living creature is treated as a plant for the purposes of spells and effects that harm or otherwise inconvenience plant creatures more than other creatures. The victim would thus be subject to antiplant shell, blight, and additional damage from horrid wilting or a plant bane weapon, and could be affected by control plants.

Such creatures take 20d10 points of damage and 1d8 points of Strength drain, or half with a successful DC 39 Fortitude save. A plant that isn't a creature (such as a tree or a shrub) doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies.

Yet he still possesses the typical nascent demon lord traits, which are similar to those possessed by a typical demon, only more potent, as summarized here. <ul><li> Immunity to death effects, electricity, charm and compulsion effects, and poison. <li> Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30. <li> Summon (Sp) Once per day, nascent demon lords can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell. <li> Telepathy 300 ft. <li> A nascent demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction. <li> Nascent demon lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the nascent demon lord's behalf. All nascent demon lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil-in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to the nascent demon lord's themes and interests.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/>Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, was once the favored minion and lieutenant (some even say child) of Cyth-V'sug, Demon Lord of Fungus and Parasites. After a failed attempt to wrest that crown away from Cyth-V'sug, Treerazer fled to the Material Plane. Cyth-V'sug was unable (or perhaps only unwilling) to pursue, but took steps to ensure that Treerazer would remain there by exiling him, transforming Treerazer into a native outsider and severing his bond to the Abyss-if the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is slain, his animus will not return to the Abyss and reform.Death, to Treerazer, is a permanent thing.Treerazer arrived on Golarion near the end of the Age of Darkness, and found the savaged planet much to his liking-so much so that the sting of exile was somewhat ameliorated. He spent many centuries wandering the remote corners of Golarion before finally coming upon the abandoned elven nation of Kyonin in 2497 ar. In the Sovyrian Stone, he found an artifact that he believed he could use to reinstate his Abyssal link and, perhaps, even uproot the entire nation and refocus the portal from Sovyrian to the Abyss, thereby reclaiming his position there and taking one more step toward revenge against Cyth-V'sug.Yet the elves sensed his tamperings and returned to confront the demon. A terrific battle resulted, and while the elves were able to drive Treerazer out of Iadara and into southern Kyonin, they were unable to slay him or force him out completely-they merely concentrated his power in a smaller region. Instead, the elves \"walled off \" this region, a perverted realm known today as the Tanglebriar. Treerazer lurks at the Tanglebriar's heart to this day, the greatest bogeyman in elven mythology and a very real and constant threat to the nation's security.Treerazer begins most combats by casting time stop and raising an antiplant shell to prevent plant creatures (including creatures under the effect of his aura of corruption) from approaching. If he has time, he also creates walls of thorns and summons demons (usually four nalfeshnees and 12 hezrous). In melee, Treerazer gleefully takes up Blackaxe and makes full attacks against the closest foe, or Greater Vital Strikes if he's forced to move or charge. During the first 3 rounds of combat, he targets obvious spell effects with quickened greater dispel magic. If Treerazer is reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, he teleports back to his fortress, Witchbole, to recover and plan his revenge.",

Considering itself the ultimate protector of the jungle, a tunche prowls its domain in search of any who might despoil this vibrant and lush environment. If a tunche encounters travelers who treat the jungle with proper respect, it might simply observe them or demand an offering in exchange for allowing them to pass through its territory. A tunche especially enjoys toying with its victims, using its magic to confuse and mislead its opponents. A tunche rarely kills a foe without toying with it first, unless the target is actively harming plants or animals. A tunche stands 20 feet tall and weighs 4,000 pounds.",

Sages say that these creatures come from the cold, dark places between the stars, and that in the darkness of any eclipse, one can see their immense, world-darkening shadows. Some claim ancient and forgotten deities of death and destruction created the first tzitzimitls as instruments of apocalypse, while others speculate they come from faraway worlds where immense planets teem with creatures of this scale, and that the immortal dead of these dark globes are banished to other worlds to spread devastation. Tzitzimitls as a whole offer neither affirmation nor denial for these claims, and in fact seem to glory in such legends. Certainly, the arrival of a tzitzimitl upon a world heralds the advent of a time of great trouble, although whether or not the tzitzimitl actually presages such dark times or is the cause of them is a matter of debate. On some planets, tzitzimitls have already arrived, yet they lie dormant in ancient tombs, imprisoned ages ago by heroes who are long forgotten today. A tzitzimitl is 50 feet tall.",

This green fire is akin to vomiting up the countless souls the vavakia has consumed, and these souls consume flesh as surely as they consume sanity. A creature struck by this breath weapon takes 20d6 points of damage (DC 30 Reflex half )-this damage manifests as blackened, melted flesh and skin but is treated as raw profane power. Evil creatures take half damage from the breath weapon, but good creatures who take any damage from a vavakia's breath weapon are automatically staggered for 1 round by the hideous sensation. In addition, any living creature that takes damage from a vavakia's breath weapon must also make a DC 30 Fortitude save to avoid suffering 1d8 points of Wisdom drain as her sanity slips away into madness. Immediately after the vavakia expels this green \"soulfire,\" the wailing flames flow in reverse back into the demon's gullet through its open maw. This heals the vavakia 1d8 points of damage for each creature that was damaged by its breath weapon. The Wisdom drain element of this breath weapon is a mind-affecting effect.

The smoking wounds cause the victim to become sickened because of the hideous sensation and rank smell of the vapors. An effect that removes this sickened condition only temporarily causes the wounds to stop smoking-they begin smoking again in 1d6 rounds and persist as long as the victim suffers from the associated negative levels. Nonliving creatures bitten by a vavakia are immune to its energy-draining bite and do not exhibit smoking wounds. The Fortitude save to remove these negative levels is DC 25.

Vavakias form on the Abyss from particularly cruel mortal souls who, in life, practiced the vile act of extracting, enslaving, and even consuming other souls.

Of course, Lamashtu herself rose from the Abyss spontaneously, shortly after the daemons first \"taught\" the Abyss how to process sinful souls, but that difference meant little to the Mother of Monsters. Fueled by this rage, she waged war against Abaddon for many years and captured two Horsemen of the Apocalypse-predecessors of those who hold those titles now. She murdered one of them, and forced from the other the secret method of manipulating souls and the Abyss before murdering him as well. Both murdered Horsemen were soon replaced on Abaddon, but by that point Lamashtu's wrath had been spent and all that remained was her own curiosity.Most of Lamashtu's earliest attempts to create demonic life were hideous failures, but even in these failures Lamashtu found joy and delight. It wasn't until the demon used her own body as an incubator to shape and then eventually birth the first vavakias that she had her first real success. Lamashtu's early work in creating and manipulating the Abyss in this manner may have much to do with her resulting rise in power to the position of Queen of Demons-had not her escalating war with Pazuzu forced her attentions away from this hideous form of \"art,\" there's no telling what other strange demonic races she might have birthed upon the world. Now that she is a true goddess, Lamashtu's interests expand far beyond the \"curiosities\" of the Abyss, and she has little time or desire to wallow in her home plane's fecund properties. Of course, other demon lords throughout the Abyss are eager to learn these secrets, but to date, none have managed to duplicate Lamashtu's feats of creation.In any event, the vavakias themselves have proven a phenomenal success, and are among the Abyss's most dangerous demonic races today.",

      "description": "Veranallias are among the most powerful azatas known and embody the changing of the seasons, from blossoming spring to dormant winter. They command the growth and decay of plants, control various aspects of the weather, and enrich soil with the remains of fallen foes. A veranallia stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds. Beautiful and majestic, the queenly veranallia possesses a form that combines aspects of a feylike woman and the subtle power of nature. A veranallia appears humanoid from the waist up, but where her thighs and legs should be, sprout countless vines, leaves, and various kinds of plant matter instead. These flora represent the life of plants throughout all stages of the year, continually shifting from blooming, verdant colors and textures to crisp, withered specimens and back in a matter of seconds. Veranallias hail from the wildest regions of Elysium, primeval realms where few but the mightiest azatas dare tread. They are creatures of transition, preferring the unpredictable maelstroms of weather at Elysium's edges to the more temperate or consistent regions of that plane. They also have a particular appreciation for areas where one element transitions into another, such as coastlines, geysers, hot springs, and underground lakes. Many among their kind can be found in the lush Field of Broken Tyrants or various heavily wooded forests throughout Elysium; as many as a dozen veranallias are reputed to dwell among the ever-changing trees and plants of the Painted Forest, and it is thought their annual tribunals are actually the source of the eldritch woodland's transformative climate and continually shifting composition. At first glance, a veranallia's lower body may appear to be made of living plants that wrap themselves around her, but these vines are in fact a part of the azata's strange physiology. Despite this, she is not subject to blight or similar plant-affecting magic, and attempts to use such abilities to hinder her inspire a veranallia's ire like little else. A veranallia's vines are incredibly strong and can entwine and crush an enemy as easily as a python would crush a field mouse. These vines often change appearance based on the veranallia's environment, but not always in any predictable or sensible manner. Veranallias prefer the company of other azatas, and may have any number of faithful bralani or ghaele followers. Their fickle natures make it difficult for most other creatures, even other azatas, to interact with them. Lillends are not inspired by the dangerous power of veranallias, and brijidines' belief in the cleansing power of fire does not make friendship with the verdant veranallias easy. While most other celestials concede that veranallias have only the best intentions, most would still rather deal with more predictable members of the celestial planes. Archons in particular find it almost impossible to speak to veranallias, and the noble angels and agathions have trouble following a veranallia's leaps in logic and rapidly shifting moods. Due to their power and inf luence, it takes a force of great evil to slay veranallias. When a veranallia does die, however, her body explodes into a fine glittering dust that covers a radius of up to a mile. This area becomes exceedingly fertile and subject to indeterminate weather. Storms, snowfalls, heat waves, and gentle showers come by turns regardless of the region's usual climate. Veranallias who have died on the evil Outer Planes have left such fertile areas behind, but the soil inevitably becomes corrupted again, giving rise to vile creatures such as sards and spawning vicious weather patterns. Hardy plane-traveling adventurers speak of ancient veranallias living in the remotest corners of Elysium, and claim that these unique azatas possess even greater mastery over the elements than their more commonly encountered kin. Veranallias with the ability to shower entire mountains with lightning or cause heat waves so intense that they turn lakes to sand are spoken of in arcane texts in the Great Library of Harmonious Scripture of Heaven.",

When Vildeis emerged from the Heavens, she was a being of sublime beauty, but of a majesty so delicate that she couldn't suffer the sight or even the thought of evil. Within an hour of her birth, she had put out her own eyes, refusing to even gaze upon a reality tainted by sin. Since the first self-inflicted wound marred her once-perfect body, she has struggled against evil in all its forms. Denying herself home or rest, Vildeis harrows the wildest reaches of the multiverse, driving back the expansions of foul realms and slaying those who would do wicked deeds. Vildeis has no home among the planes, and forgoes any comforts-even those as basic as shelter or company-so long as there is evil afoot in the multiverse. Such makes her one of the most aloof empyreal lords, but also one of the most storied. Across the planes, legends tell of pitched battles, desperate last stands, and near massacres turned in the favor of the innocent by the sudden appearance of Vildeis herself, bloody-winged and avenging. While such miraculous rescues have more to do with happenstance then omniscience, they nonetheless inf lame the passions of the righteous across countless worlds. Those who seek to encounter the empyreal lord of devotion, sacrifice, and scars must follow rumors of her passing, usually spoken by awed beings and crippled fiends along the fringes of reality's darkest outlands. Nearly as well known as the Cardinal Martyr herself are her morbid trappings-miles of stained bandages, scars etched and re-etched in the shapes of celestial runes, and a dagger that drips with her blood as often as that of her enemies. Of these, her dagger Cicatrix is the most infamous, a black blade like a thorn dropped from some gigantic iron rose, which the empyreal lord used to blind herself. Tales tell that she uses her blade not just to slay the wicked and share her blindness, but to carve the runes that crisscross her body upon others, infusing them with the compulsion to battle evil even if previously there was no such desire. <br/></br>",

Vildeis, and by extension her worshipers, is extremely strict when it comes to adhering to her tenets of living an austere and principled life wholly devoted to combating evil. Those who diverge from Vildeis's teachings are expelled from her orders, but encouraged to do good in the world under the service of gentler masters. Though Vildeis doesn't expect all of her followers to perform the same self-mortification that she does, tattoos, scarification, and flagellation are common among her servants, especially her most devoted priests. Even those who don't engage in ritual bloodletting typically wear long red ribbons, symbolic of the empyreal lord's eternal wounds. Vildeis's holy symbol is a scarred golden breastplate. Her favored weapon is the dagger. Her clerics have access to the Destruction, Good, Healing, and Law domains, and to the Rage and Resurrection subdomains.</br>",

The defining sin of these souls was pride, fueled by vanity and a desire for adulation and ever-greater authority to be wielded in whatever selfish way they saw fit, coupled with a furious envy of anyone more beloved, respected, or feared than they. Vilsteths epitomize these traits, and can often be found lurking in monuments dedicated to important political figures or disguised within statues of prominent saints and heroes.

Instead, the souls of corrupt mortals find their way to Baphomet's Ivory Labyrinth after judgment, and in there gradually transform into these crooked beings. From their positions of power, the sinful souls that birth vilsteths manifested every kind of malfeasance, from pecuniary greed to self-indulgence of gluttony, sloth, and lust in life, but the common thread is always the arrogation of the self over the state or church or whatever organization upon which they presided, coupled with a narcissistic smugness that their pride and pleasures were of greater import than any other consideration. Of course, these sinful leaders' cynical pragmatism demanded that they keep their perverted proclivities secret, as they knew those beneath them would never understand, so each spun an ever-expanding labyrinth of lies to keep their corruption under cover. Some succeeded, living out their days shrouded in their sinister secrets; others failed spectacularly, leading to dissolution, schism, treason, social collapse, and revolution when the extent of the awful truth finally surfaced. Whether their sins were ever exposed, however, their corrupted pride and devious secrecy drew their souls into the Abyss and the Ivory Labyrinth of Baphomet, where they formed into vilsteth demons. Vilsteths do not eat or drink in the usual sense. Their faces are like ivory masks-unmoving, impassive, and implacable, with only the glow of their amber eyes to mark their attention. Instead, they are emotional parasites, feeding on the reactions of others, sowing confusion and suffering and feasting upon the psychic residue that follows. Likewise, they do not speak with voices that humans might understand. Their communication is purely telepathic, from a subtle whisper to a psychic scream, echoing down the corridors of the minds of those to whom they \"speak\" and pushing them, whether gently or urgently, toward acts of sabotage, sedition, and sin of every kind.",

They amass vast monetary wealth for common bribery and for lavish parties hosted by their minions in order to tempt and corrupt the unwary and the unwise. They encourage and inspire artists and sculptors to raise great monuments and masterworks for their own glory, and through these graven images they spy and speak and exercise a quiet dominion upon the great and small alike, working through prominent and respected leaders to delude the masses and subvert the common good. When vilsteths are encountered outside of the Abyss, these demons are often found in places where Baphomet's cults hold power. In rural areas, such cults may form around insular villages that have abandoned the traditional gods of hunt and harvest, trading them for a predatory faith hidden from the eyes of outsiders. In urban settlements, cultic cells and clandestine rites conducted behind masks and veils work together to suborn existing governmental, legal, and cultural authorities. Vilsteth demons may visit Baphomet's faithful in either milieu, acting as ambassadors and agents provocateur, often sitting in judgment of those who have violated the cult's confidentiality and helping to design and implement their agendas for anarchy and societal upheaval.",

When it does so, it leaves behind a temporary lesser sphere of annihilation in a square of its choice that was part of its space before it teleported. This sphere of annihilation cannot be caused to move by other creatures, but the sphere itself moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) toward the closest Tiny or larger creature on the oni's next turn. If no appropriate creature is within 30 feet, the sphere does not move that round. If the sphere enters a square occupied by a creature (or if a creature touches the sphere), that creature is affected as if by a disintegrate spell (CL 20th, DC 23). Once the sphere damages a creature with this effect, the sphere vanishes-it also vanishes on its own after 24 hours in the unlikely event that it never discharges on a creature. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br/>The concept of the void is a difficult one for many individuals to grasp, for it encompasses more than just an absence of anything. The concept of \"void\" as an element also represents the heavens above, the dark places between the stars, the nature of the spiritual world, and even the capacity to create and envision new ideas. The void yai represents all of these possibilities, interpreted in a way that exemplifies the evil of the oni race. Unlike lesser oni, the void yai does not represent any single humanoid race-the closest it comes is perhaps the rune giant, and certainly the void yai superficially resembles monsters of legend, with its dark, heavily muscled body, horns, and fangs. A void yai manifests when the combination of an extremely powerful oni spirt and an overwhelmingly evil location intersect at precisely the right time. Rarely, an eldritch transformation spontaneously elevates an existing yai to the vaunted status of void yai-whispers of vile rituals that an oni can perform to quicken this transformation keep some sages awake at night, for if such rituals existed, then all oni could potentially become void yai-a sobering thought indeed, given the void yai's daunting capacity for cruelty. As with almost all oni, the void oni's use of weapons and armor seems like cruel overkill. A void oni is 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds. Void yai turn toward the Material Plane to satisfy their desires, lording over lesser creatures with the aid of the void. A void yai usually claims a huge territory, bringing much larger creatures to heel as servants. As with fire yai, a void yai makes frequent use of lesser oni as its minions, but prefers to surround itself with whatever giant tribe or society it has conquered. Rarely, a void yai commands kingdoms of smaller humanoids, but since the immense void yai has no ability to assume the shape of such small and insignificant creatures, it often feels awkward and out of place. More so than other yai, void yai are ashamed of their true appearance-their vanity is such that most are masters of using their change shape ability to appear as breathtakingly handsome or beautiful giants, and it is in this form they prefer to live. Only when combat begins does their rage take control, causing them to revert to their true, horrific shapes.",

While void yai typically content themselves with ruling nations, voidlords arrive with a greater mission-to control entire worlds and bring all that dwell upon these worlds to their knees. Voidlords are always void yai with additional racial Hit Dice or class levels-levels of fighter, monk, and rogue are favorite choices for voidlords. These powerful outsiders generally eschew spellcasting classes under the opinion that might and the oni's inborn supernatural abilities are a greater path to conquest than mortal magic. In addition to having the typical void yai abilities, each voidlord possesses an additional number of powers keyed to that voidlord's particular area of focus.

A warsworn forms by the will of a god or goddess of undeath or war, or spontaneously from the bloodlust and wrath of a battlefield of dead soldiers. Once created, a warsworn exists to spread the rage of war, ravage the land, and spread the carnage of battle. A typical warsworn weighs several tons and can reach a height of up to 25 feet. A newly formed one is much smaller, but quickly consumes nearby corpses from a battlefield or mass grave and swells to its full size. It is always hungry for more dying bodies. It prefers to absorb warriors and soldiers, but willingly consumes any suitable humanoid. Its constant grinding motion breaks its component parts, giving it plenty of scrap to hurl at distant foes.",

Unlike most oni, water yai have no real longing to rule or infiltrate societies- yet they still enjoy posing as humanoids. They often assume the forms of enormous merfolk in the water, but prefer to adopt the shapes of storm giants when on land. The water yai then pursues its favorite decadence-the acclimation of material wealth and luxuries. Water yai tend to be easily distracted by beautiful treasures, and despite their evil natures are prone to acts of unexpected frivolity.",

The wind yai selects the direction it wishes to throw its victims, and may select a different direction for each victim, though each must be thrown in a straight line. Creatures take falling damage for any impacts while traveling up or down in this way; if a creature collides with an object during its sideways movement, both the creature and the object take 1d6 points of damage and the creature is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.",

Upon being struck by this attack, the victim must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br/>Wind yai may take after the graceful cloud giants in general appearance, but given their hard, icy stares and the brooding manner in which they carry themselves, observers may not immediately relate the two races. Whereas cloud giants wear their finely made robes and ornate jewelry with an air of regality and serenity, their oni imitators manage to make even the humblest garments and adornments seem ostentatious, and are always shrouded in an air of darkness that many liken to an ill omen. Though wind yai look as though they have one foot in the light of day and the other in the darkness of night, the shadow that perpetually swirls about the otherworldly beings is not the result of any natural source; in actuality, the supernatural night that constantly follows wind yai is a raw magical manifestation of their foul intentions and evil nature. Wind yai do not shape the winds-they force their will upon them, commanding the powers of the sky to commit acts of domineering brutality with none of the natural grace normally associated with the element. Whereas a cloud giant is always accompanied by a gentle breeze, the malicious wind yai brings with it only furious storms, the chaotic winds tossing its hair about and blowing dust into its unblinking triad of eyes.

An unexpected wayward breeze is enough to throw a stony-faced wind yai into a fit of rage, the delicate motions of nature an ever-present reminder of the wind yai's own blustering presence and lack of grace. Thus are wind yai desperate to gain some semblance of control over the capricious winds, and they use their sheer might and monstrous resolve to bend that untamable force to their will, taking pleasure in not only controlling nature, but also using it for unnatural acts of destruction. Wind yai tend to wear thick, showy robes and heavy jewelry, though their great strength still allows them to move swiftly and with ease. Like all yai, wind yai each possess a third eye through which they can emit rays of destructive energy. In the case of wind yai, this powerful beam takes the form of a lightning bolt, as the oni channel the very essence of the storm into their attacks, simultaneously electrocuting their opponents while rendering them deaf with the cacophonous boom of thunder that follows the attack. They also possess the unique ability to send their foes flying into the air, commanding bursts of wind to carry their enemies aloft and bring them crashing back to the earth.",

But rather than use such delicate tools to create melodious works of art, wind yai are interested in their more destructive properties, and have a particular respect for bards, especially those who bend others to their will with their music. Thus do they tend to seek out such rhythmically inclined individuals, and when faced with a foe who possesses musical skill, wind yai will invariably seek to keep that individual alive, so they can force it to serve as the wind yai's enslaved jester and musician. An ensnared performer is usually forced to entertain its master until its fingers are cracked and raw and it inevitably falters while playing. Wind yai are hardly patient creatures, but nothing sets them off in quite the same way as a weak or inept musician, and even the most innocent mistake can mean the fatal end for an indentured bard. When wind yai are not presented with a suitable performer to capture and dominate, they seek out magical instruments, having a particular affection for rare, magical instruments, especially those with strings. A wind yai takes great pride in its musical possessions, and also finds a unique pleasure in assembling masses of enslaved musicians to perform thunderous symphonies. Wind yai also take great pleasure in dominating cloud giants, perhaps even more so than bards, as they revere cloud giants' heavenly melodies above all others. Rather than apprehend these giants one by one, however, wind yai seek to dominate entire tribes of such beings, using their powers over the skies to trick particularly superstitious groups into thinking the oni are earthbound demigods or celestial messengers sent from on high. Groups of wind yai can be an even fiercer force, gathering entire legions of cloud giants under their command and leading them in aerial campaigns against helpless creatures on land. Evil cloud giants tend to make the best soldiers for wind yai leaders, though if the oni can manage to sway good-aligned cloud giants under their banner, the subsequent wars they wage are all the more satisfying.",

Xoveron himself towers at a height of 25 feet, with a wingspan of just over 50 feet. When the Horned Prince moves, the sound of stone grinding on stone can be heard, as if the demon lord himself were composed not of flesh but of some unholy stone come to demonic life. Xoveron is often accompanied by numerous vrolikai and ulkreth demons (see page 82). Gargoyles of tremendous size often serve at the Horned Prince's whim, as do monsters with a reputation for hunger and gluttony, such as purple worms or man-eating animals. His realm on the Abyss is an immense, ruined city called Ghahazi, said to have been constructed over the eons by the Horned Prince, who plucked decaying districts and crumbling structures from dead cities across countless worlds. <br/></br>",

In such regions, the landscapes of ruined cities and devastated skylines appeal to those who worship the Horned Prince; his cultists raise temples to their demonic patron there in caverns, on ruined rooftops, or within the skeletal frames of partially collapsed cathedrals to gods whose faith and worship alike have moved on. Defenestration is far and away the favored method of sacrifice for his cult. In addition to gargoyles, the cult is particularly fond of and even subservient to the nabasu demons. Often, a cult of Xoveron seeks out a newly \"born\" nabasu and offers itself to the demon. Usually this means the demon takes a few of the cultists to feed on and demands the survivors seek out more victims on a regular basis, but in some cases the ravenous newborn nabasu simply consumes the entire cult. To the fanatic of Xoveron, though, such a fate is worth dying for. Xoveron's unholy symbol is a five-horned gray gargoyle skull that's missing its lower jaw. His favored weapon is the ranseur. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Earth, Evil, and Strength, and to the subdomains of Caves, Demon, Entropy, and Ferocity. Entropy is a subdomain of Chaos, and is detailed on page 15 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Fiends.</br>",

      "description": "Equal parts regal and horrifying to mortal sensibilities, yamarajes preside as judges of death and dispensers of ultimate justice. Superstitions of the living call them by many names-the final judges, the grave magistrates, the dragons who eat men's souls-but all agree that these nobles of death wither even the stoutest hearts. The grave magistrates glide with authority throughout Purgatory, commanding flocks of lesser psychopomps, tolerating the ministrations of devils and angels bickering for souls of note, and ordering the endless procession of petitioners. Many also serve as diplomats or military commanders to maintain Purgatory's neutrality, but any such role is secondary to maintaining the flow of souls and the balance of the multiverse. Though in theory each yamaraj answers to the gods of death, in practice each is unquestioned within its own courtroom. Yamarajes vaguely resemble black dragons, though they are easily distinguished once one realizes the gigantic creatures are cloaked in feathers rather than scales. Each yamaraj measures at least 30 feet in length and weighs 4 tons. Despite their massive size and largely sedentary duties, yamarajes show astounding grace when they move. Impossibly old, yamarajes are outsiders forged from lesser psychopomps or the souls of legendary mortals. As with other outsiders, they need not eat, drink, or sleep to survive, and the grave magistrates normally remain perched upon Purgatory's ruins for months at a time, overseeing the smooth organization of their realm. Hard work wears at their immortal drive, and like living lords, they eagerly indulge in exquisite banquets during their infrequent personal time. These bacchanals make for strange bedfellows among outsiders, as solars and pit fiends may hobnob alongside one another, vying for the attention of a yamaraj to help organize the release of judged souls and attempting to win future favors. When called into physical action, all yamarajes can breathe raw decay in the form of clouds of carrion-eating insects, and their venom saps the youth and vitality from living creatures. Yamarajes serve as lower judges and lords of Purgatory, directing the activities of other outsiders there, presiding over the dead, pre-sorting souls destined for ultimate judgment by the death gods, and seeing to the efficiency and safety of the plane's infinite inhabitants. As the highest order of psychopomps, they are simultaneously the most dedicated to their role as shepherds of the dead and the most prone to impressing their own opinions on their work in the form of overturning precedents, rambling speeches, and extensive opinions attached to rulings. Such flexibility is necessary when making immortal decisions based on the ever-changing actions of the living, but frustrates more absolute outsiders to no end. Unsurprisingly, yamarajes tend to vary greatly from one individual to the next. Most develop deep interests in various worldly subjects that determine the sorts of mortals they ultimately choose to watch over. A given yamaraj might go out of its way to seek out artisans, followers of specific deities, or thieves, depending on its studies or whatever has come to interest it during that eon. Yamarajes might seek to guard such pet souls, ensuring their safe travels through Purgatory, learning more from the souls as they journey together, and ultimately advocating that the death gods grant a more peaceful judgment. Others act in reverse, finding certain sorts of mortals truly disgusting, tormenting their souls through their procession to the goddess's throne, and even suggesting that the spirits should face particularly monstrous damnations. How a yamaraj reacts to an individual thus proves unpredictable, depending on its changeable tastes. Such idiosyncrasies vary between individual yamarajes, and might change over the course of centuries. Just as many yamarajes become fascinated with souls possessing specif ic experiences or from certain backgrounds, some of the psychopomps go out of their way to judge beings from specif ic worlds, collecting bits of information and insight with every creature that passes them by. Thus, some become experts on one or multiple worlds, having spent eternities ferreting out the histories and secrets of worlds from firsthand accounts over millennia of inquiries. Many yamarajes welcome the opportunity to share the details of their investigations, though they sometimes see inquiries into their worlds of expertise as opportunities to conscript new allies to aid the psychopomps' cause. Standing at the pinnacle of their race, yamarajes are well informed as to the challenges and goals of many subservient psychopomps, and might only negotiate with mortals who perform a service in aid of their underlings.",

      "description": "Yamasoth, known also as the Polymorph Plague, dwells in the endless cavern realm of Sekatar- Seraktis in the Abyss. Constantly at war with bickering balor lords and other powerful demons, Yamasoth has held his own as the lord of the Abyss's largest, most centralized region: the Kingdom of New Flesh. The \"new flesh\" in question consists of the qlippoth lord's subjects- men and women from countless worlds who may have been kings and queens at one time, but here are nothing more than base monsters, vermin, and beasts to serve at Yamasoth's whim. Some he feeds upon. Others he keeps for his harem. But the bulk of the denizens of the Kingdom of New Flesh are soldiers. In this army, other qlippoth serve as commanders and generals, particularly Yamasoth's favored minions, the gongorinans (see page 90). Unlike most qlippoth, Yamasoth does not necessarily prefer to kill but rather to transform. A human who sins and dies produces a soul that fuels the demonic horde, but a dumb beast or feral monster who dies is merely carrion. By transforming free-willed mortals into monsters, Yamasoth's Army of the New Flesh only becomes more capable of ending worlds. Yamasoth's centuries-long alliance with Runelord Alaznist may have eventually resulted in such an assault on Golarion, but the devastation of Earthfall ended those plans before Yamasoth's burgeoning realm could finalize its gestation-proof that even in the greatest of disasters, some good is wrought. Yamasoth's interest in transformations goes far beyond mere polymorphing. The qlippoth lord is also fascinated by the act of fleshwarping and reworking life into new forms of mutants. Rumors state that the nature of the experiments that take place deep in the Kingdom of New Flesh closely mimic those the daemons performed in the Abyss so long ago that resulted in the first demons. In fact, some dissident demonologists claim Yamasoth himself is a nascent demon lord, and is in fact that first, primal demon born of daemonic tampering with Abyssal quintessence and sinful souls.",

      "description": "The dread Zelishkar of the Bitter Flame is a figure much feared on the crumbling plains of Abaddon and across the multiverse. A monstrous feline in shape but seemingly sculpted of lurid crimson flame, Zelishkar is girded with a crest and cuirass of infernally strengthened obsidian, shaved to razor thinness yet losing none of its terrible strength. His eyes are jet-black pits that mirror his armor, though pinpoints of awful orange radiance gleam deep within. He is surrounded always by a heat shimmer that diffuses his blinding radiance. Zelishkar is reputed to sense the presence of his prey by the tiniest variations in temperature, tracking the movements of creatures both seen and unseen before he pounces. His own fires burn with a hellish uncleanness, tainting even those who thought themselves proofed against his flames and rapidly consuming their body and soul, leaving nothing behind but befouled ashes. Zelishkar is feared as much for his incisive tactical acumen as for his dreadful and terrifying powers in close combat. He has single-handedly withered and despoiled cities and farmlands when summoned in the name of his daemonic mistress-Szuriel, patron of war and suffering. She forged Zelishkar's form in the deepest pits of the Cinder Furnace as her terrifying harbinger, embodying the hopeless misery of funeral pyres that consume and cremate the dead in the wake of the war that she brings. He proved so adept that she judged him worthy to transcend his purpose, and he has come to embody all of the hateful and sadistic purposes that fire serves. His name is invoked now by torturers and inquisitors alike as they consign their hapless captives to the ultimate agonies of being burned alive, and even by arsonists both petty and grand. All twisted souls who love nothing more than to see the world burn offer up silent praises to Zelishkar in their hearts; even if they never speak his name, the hate that burns within them is a sweet savor in his nostrils. Zelishkar was summoned to Golarion in ancient times, during the height of Osirion's empire, and he led legions of flaming minions against the enemies of the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues, notably the Jistka Imperium. In a twist of supreme hubris, the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues turned against his summoned ally after several successful campaigns, and chose Zelishkar to be the test subject of his grandest experiment yet. The Osirian king had just finished construction of a grand labyrinth south of the Alamein Peninsula, and in a display of prideful foolishness ordered Zelishkar to be imprisoned within to prove the infallibility of his maze. It took the efforts of an entire army of summoned genies to lock the daemonic harbinger away beneath the desert's churning sands, but his imprisonment was absolute with the aid of an ancient efreeti and a legendary artifact known as the Bottle of the Bound. Through all the long millennia since, Zelishkar and the remnant of his host have remained imprisoned beneath the Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh, the city founded by the Song Pharaoh upon her victory over the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues years after Zelishkar's detention. He has emerged from his prison but once, when Szuriel and the ironically named Incorruptible Pharaoh joined to loose his fiery fury upon one of the sky-cities of Shory. His destructive rampage could not be contained, however, and he devastated several cities and oases of western Osirion before he and his host were finally bound back within their prison. There he remains, plotting burning vengeance upon Osirion and all of Golarion for his ages of durance vile.",

Some travel to the Material Plane and adapt to its woodlands, defending them against massive destruction-forest fires, logging, undead armies, and so on-and use their abilities to heal and regrow damaged areas. Rather than having a distinct physical body, a zomok is more like a spirit animating a collective mass of vegetation, and over time it sheds and acquires new material from its environment, changing its appearance to match its current location. Zomoks do not need to eat, and any creature they swallow is usually left behind as a mashed corpse to decay and provide nutrition for plants. A typical zomok is about 18 feet tall and 30 feet long, and weighs 30 tons.",
