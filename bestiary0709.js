      "description": "Aashaq's wyverns resemble the typical wyverns commonly found throughout the Inner Sea region in many regards, but they have been warped by magic. Unlike their more mundane cousins, these wyverns have bifurcated tails that allow for two stinging attacks, and are able to emit a noxious blast of gas that burns and blinds those in its path. Aashaq's wyverns reside in the natural caves that honeycomb the cliffs of Dahak's Teeth, and were common wyverns until the evil dragon Aashaq commandeered the islands. Seeing these beasts as the perfect deacons for her dark cult, Aashaq twisted the very fabric of the wyverns until she settled upon the form now most commonly encountered on Dahak's Teeth. Their very name is indicative of the wyverns' servitor status, and they are occasionally even ridden as mounts by Dahak cultists. Aashaq gives her wyvern minions a remarkable amount of freedom, but most never stray too far from the three islands that make up Dahak's Teeth. Mariners who make their way past the dreaded isles know to watch out for the beasts, which assail unprepared ships from both sky and water in order to feed upon their crews and capture their cargo for Aashaq. The corrupting inf luence of Aashaq's chaotic manipulations has also provided these unpredictable creatures with resistance to acid, fire, and magic. A typical Aashaq's wyvern is 18 feet in length (including its bifurcated tail) and weighs 2,500 pounds. Their scales can vary in tint, but are usually purple. Though only slightly more intelligent than their common kin, the Dahak-worshiping wyverns enjoy lording their \"superior\" status over the lesser specimens found on other islets.",

An adhukait is adept at infiltration and escape. In killing, the fiend is brutally efficient unless it wishes to prolong pain to demoralize or enrage its enemies. Although an adhukait appears to be two connected creatures, it is one entity with two minds. The creature's personality and purpose is as unified as its bizarre form. An adhukait is 6 feet tall. It weighs 330 pounds. Adhukaits prefer desolate spots as lairs, especially those that recall past terror or sorrow. In such dens, they keep trophies from their engagements as focuses for meditation and objects of study. Adhukaits also keep treasures stolen from temples and holy places. While at rest, adhukaits remain near any ill-gotten items to ensure no meddling magician can locate the lost objects. Legend holds that the first adhukaits emerged from the shattered remains of two godlike brigands. These burglars, their names long since lost to history, attempted to raid a celestial hall. The resident deity and his or her servants slew the thieves, crushed their bodies together into one, and hurled their remains to the earth. As their crumbling, entwined bodies struck the world, they caused terrible earthquakes and tsunamis that slew thousands of innocents-including many worshipers of the headstrong deity who accidentally caused the devastation. The first adhukaits grew from the shattered, mingled remains of these brigands, rising from the blasted crater to serve the asuras as elite soldiers.",

Yet the most dangerous thing about the angazhani (as the creatures call themselves) is not their strength, but rather their intellect. For behind each angazhani's fury lies a cold, calculating mind. Whether this intelligence is the product of evolution or meddling by unholy powers, all angazhani honor the demon lord Angazhan. Reclusive by nature, high girallon clans settle the most secluded depths of the jungles, generally inhabiting ruined cities and misty mountain temples. There they rule as divine priestkings over tribes of lesser apes. These congregations sometimes even include humanoid slaves or cultists, though the angazhani prefer raiding and collect tribute over commanding direct service. They rarely reveal themselves to outsiders, and instead quietly gather strength against the day their patron sends them out to claim all the world's forests. High girallons stand 9 feet tall and weigh nearly a thousand pounds. They often dress in hides, and they fight with exotically shaped throwing axes or sacrificial knives.",

      "description": "From time to time, when a powerfully imaginative sleeper wakes from a particularly vivid or unusual dream, a fragment of that dream lingers on the Ethereal Plane. To survive, this animate dream needs the power of living will, imagination, and emotion to sustain it. An animate dream seeks out mortal minds, appearing as a shadowy and often frightful dream figure. Its true appearance is vague and nebulous, but it reacts to the fears and emotions of those around it, taking on a nightmarish appearance that differs for each viewer. An animate dream can find satisfaction and sustenance by passing one of its ghostly limbs through a mortal's body-the act infusing the mortal with negative energy that sates the animate dream's unnatural hunger. But by forcing a creature into a state of sleep, terror, or both, the animate dream can gain a much more satisfying meal, feeding on the emotions released in such states. It uses its spell-like abilities to this end, for each creature it harms with its nightmares, drives temporarily insane with confusion or fear, or outright slays with phantasmal killer provides the monster with more nourishment. An animate dream forced to go for a long period of time without feeding does not starve to death, but does grow increasingly feral and violent in nature. Animate dreams sometimes associate with other creatures from the Ethereal Plane or that have associations with dreams and nightmares, such as night hags, phase spiders, and xills. Sometimes these alliances are mutually beneficial, but in many cases the animate dreams are treated as slaves. Night hags in particular like enslaving animate dreams, and sometimes use their essence as a component in creating heartstones.",

      "description": "Aurumvoraxes are very aggressive creatures, and lead solitary lives except when they mate. Adults typically claim the hunting area within a mile of their warrens, ruthlessly driving away other predators.In addition to fresh meat, aurumvoraxes are fond of gnawing on metals (particularly gold and copper), though whether they do this to sharpen their teeth or because of some nutritional need is unknown. Aurumvorax warrens can stretch for thousands of feet, often winding deep into the earth. The avaricious appetite of aurumvoraxes has earned them the appellation \"golden gorger\" among dwarves, who have lost more than a few miners to the dangerous beasts.In battle, an aurumvorax latches onto its victim with its jaws and gouges savage wounds with its claws. It rarely looses its grip before it or its foe is dead. It typically attacks the nearest living creature regardless of size, and ignores any wounds it suffers at the hands of others until its prey is dead.A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for it is densely packed with muscle and thick, sturdy bones. Its fur is golden, while its claws are black and sharp. Its weight relative to its body size makes it a poor swimmer, and most dislike crossing water, though they can trundle along the bottom of still or slow water if necessary.Adult aurumvoraxes are impossible to train, but their offspring are valued for training as guard beasts.A healthy aurumvorax kit can be sold for 5,000 gp or more to a discerning buyer. Female aurumvoraxes rarely give birth to more than one offspring at a time, and are ferociously protective of their young.An aurumvorax drags its prey back to its lair to consume at its leisure, and its bone-midden often contains valuable belongings from past kills. Uneaten precious metals, discarded gems, and well-chewed metal items can also be found in its warrens. Despite its metallic coloration, an aurumvorax is not vulnerable to attacks that target metal, such as heat metal or the touch of a rust monster-in fact, aurumvoraxes easily kill and eat rust monsters, and some dwarf clans use aurumvorax pets to protect their storehouses against them.",

      "description": "Avorals are generally human-shaped, but their upper limbs are great wings with a human-like hand at the end of each, allowing avorals to use tools and weapons, though in battle they prefer to attack from the air and slash with the large claws on their feet and buffets from their great wings. An avoral's head has a feathery cowl instead of hair, typically brown, white, gray, or golden, and its facial features are bird-like, with a large nose and piercing eyes. Its bones are hollow but strong, making it ideal for flying. Like eagles, avorals have phenomenal vision, and can see fine details even at great distances. Though on their home plane they are content to soar among the clouds and challenge each other to diving contests among the mountain peaks, in war avorals are the scouts, spies, and messengers of the agathions. With their incredible speed, phenomenal eyesight, and magical powers, they can sneak into an area, spy on whatever lives there, silently converse with the local fauna for additional information, and fly or teleport out again with a comprehensive report. They are experts at hit-and-run attacks and are often responsible for ferrying other celestial soldiers to battle. A typical avoral is 7 feet tall but weighs only 120 pounds.",

      "description": "Stewards of ancient, colossal cities on lawful planes, axiomites represent the fundamental search for order. According to their own history, the first axiomites sprang from the raw mathematical underpinnings of the cosmos long before the first gods began to stir-they are personifications of a primordial reality made flesh in an attempt to understand itself. New axiomites are formed from souls much like celestials or fiends, with spirits drawn across the planes to one of the axiomites' humming crystal monoliths, emerging later as purified creatures of law and theory. A particular axiomite may look like any humanoid-shaped creature, though the particular form does not affect its abilities in any way. Beneath this form, all axiomites are the same-clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that constantly swirl and congeal into complex tangles of symbols and equations, making them literally creatures of pure mathematical law. Axiomite society is broken into three divisions, each with its own duty and purpose. One devotes itself to the construction and maintenance of inevitables, another to the expansion and construction of their capital city, and the third to continuing the exploration and calculation of the laws and constants that underlie all of reality. Their leader is a gestalt mind formed by the greatest individuals of their race, forming when needed and then dispersing into its component axiomites to put the god-mind's plans into action.",

An azgenzak can suppress its flames by squeezing its sac tightly closed, but it rarely does so unless it has need for stealth. If it wishes to maintain its flames even when it dives underwater, it simply enfolds a large bubble of air within its fundus, seals the aperture with a layer of mucus, and inf lates itself into a lumpy spheroid, periodically venting exhaust gases to propel itself through the water. A rush of foul-scented bubbles and brief flares of deep orange below the water's surface usually accompany such venting as jets of flame escape the azgenzak's interior and are snuffed out. Azgenzaks are primarily carnivorous, though they're able to digest any organic material, engulfing it within their flaming cavities. An azgenzak that has recently feasted-having swallowed its prey whole-might sink to the bottom of a body of water and enfold itself to slowly digest its meal, settling into a torpor for days or even weeks at a time. If undisturbed, a hibernating azgenzak might appear indistinguishable from an algae-covered boulder, a rotting log, or submerged carrion. Azgenzaks reproduce by asexual budding, which is abetted in some unknown way by the vitreous humors found within eyeballs. Its drive to extract the eyes of its prey is to further of its attempts at reproduction, as the distilled essence of the eyes it steals germinates tissue buds within the depths of its stomach. These buds then replicate and mat together into a translucent sheath of tissue, with a portion of the eyes within the azgenzak adsorbing into this sheath as it grows. Once a sufficient sheath-mass has accreted, it begins sloughing off from the parent azgenzak's stomach walls, and is eventually disgorged and discarded in a steaming puddle of semisolid translucent slime shot through with eyeballs. Now ravenously hungry, the parent moves on to feast elsewhere and replenish its discarded mass. Meanwhile, the newly birthed azgenzak begins to darken and congeal, baked from within by the unquenchable heat of its burning eyes, even as its outer tissues are tempered by exposure to open air and water, gradually toughening into a mottled brown outer skin. Gorging itself on organic matter, the newly formed azgenzak matures within a month and can begin to unleash the swarming pyrocules that are its deadly signature.",

They prefer to make their dens in murky lakes, though they are equally happy in swamps, bogs, and even slow-moving rivers. They are not powerful swimmers and avoid fast-moving water, though they are perfectly capable of climbing out of the water and traversing land in an undulant slither. Their malleable mass is able to ooze over, around, and between obstacles that might block the passage of a more solid creature. Azgenzaks are sometimes confused with will-o'-wisps in folktales and legends, as both dwell in boglands and are blamed for mysterious marshlights that lead travelers to their doom. This is because azgenzaks are thought of more in terms of the swarming pyrocules they unleash rather than their true bodies-the strings of floating, flaming eyes are often believed to be the true creature and the \"bag\" of its body a gate to Hell, a fleshy opening into the Abyss, or a shroud stitched from the skins of its victims. In many cultures, strange bubbling and dancing marshlights below the water or bobbing above bogs are seen as portents of death even when seen in the far distance, regardless of the creature responsible. In lands where azgenzaks are known to dwell, animals are often blindered at night and children are taught to keep shutters and curtains drawn tight to avoid seeing the deadly lights. In truth, azgenzaks are fairly simple creatures, mostly interested in their next meal. That said, they prefer the flesh of sentient victims and the screams of victims perishing in fear and fire. While they have no love for will-o'-wisps, they do sense a certain kinship with them, and more importantly they perceive the advantages of working with them to secure prey. Will-o'-wisps themselves offer no sustenance for an azgenzak, with their nearly immaterial bodies, but an azgenzak's ability to instill fear has much to offer hunting will-o'-wisps. The two creatures thus sometimes work in concert, with the azgenzak feasting physically upon its victims while the will-o'-wisp feeds psychically.",

Some sages speculate the creatures are not born, but rather spontaneously manifest as if spun from dreams, nightmares, and creative thoughts. Bakus are about 5 feet long and weigh 100 pounds. Bakus dislike feeding on thoughts concerning themselves, and tend to cease when their target begins thinking of the baku. For this reason, bakus keep hidden in settlements, floating in the evening air above bedrooms and boarding houses, siphoning sustenance from the dreaming populace. Bakus themselves do not sleep. Given their connection to dreams and nightmares, bakus are mortal enemies of night hags. Though usually calm and gentle creatures, bakus that encounter night hags dedicate themselves to hunting them down and ridding the world of their dark inf luence. A baku uses its ethereal jaunt spell-like ability to fight night hags as they inf lict nightmares on their victims.",

They prefer to guide individuals to their own moral decisions rather than order them to conform to a specific ideal of good. Balisse angels form from the spirits of individuals who have committed evil acts but later are redeemed and die while living an exemplary, moral life. Though balisse angels do not usually remember their mortal years, they retain a strong belief in the power of mentoring and salvation. The role of confessor is a solitary one. Balisse angels rarely interact with their own kind and cherish every minute they are able to spend on the celestial planes. Some balisse angels form long-lasting bonds with the people they have helped; between missions they may travel to visit their old success stories. Often a balisse angel leaves a mortal just as the mortal is beginning to appreciate the angel's company. Reunions are rare, but cherished all the more because of their scarcity. The average balisse angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds; its powerful wings make up the majority of this weight.",

      "description": "When hunters become utterly obsessed with the chase and indulge excessively in the savagery of the kill, their souls become progressively tainted. When such remorseless hunters perish before they can capture and kill their quarry, they sometimes rise from death as baykoks- flying undead horrors that kill purely for the ecstasy that only murder can bring them. Unlike many undead who feed on and hate all living things, a baykok seeks always to prove its mastery of the hunt. Though thoroughly wicked, baykoks often ignore all but the most powerful-looking foe in a group, only picking off lesser creatures if they dare to get between the baykok and its true prey. When it finally lays low its quarry, the baykok swoops down on the victim to devour the creature's soul in an attempt to make sure the creature never returns to seek revenge.",

      "description": "Temperamental and avaricious, the behir spends most of its time slithering through the sandy hills and desert cliffs that make up its territory, preying upon all creatures who dare to enter its hunting grounds. The creature's six pairs of powerful, clawed legs remain folded against its sides most of the time, only extending in combat to grapple foes or carry the behir forward in a terrifying, low-slung gallop, or else when climbing the sheer cliff faces common to behir lairs. The average behir is 40 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds. In addition to the two prominent horns on its head, many have additional decorative spines at regular intervals along the central ridges of their backs. While territorial and bestial in its fury, the behir is neither stupid nor necessarily evil, though its selfcenteredness and tendency to lay claim to everything visible from its high lairs frequently bring it into conf lict with other races. As such, a behir can often be bought off or reasoned with by those brave negotiators willing to get close enough to make their pitch. In these cases, a behir's tendency to attack first and ask questions later (or not at all) means that anyone seeking to strike a deal must bring powerful incentives and impress the behir immediately with his offer. It's often been speculated that behirs are somehow related to blue dragons, but the exact nature of this link remains unknown. Most dragons deny any such association and look down on the behir for its relative lack of intelligence-a snubbing that infuriates the already short-tempered behir. Thanks to this casual disparagement, many behirs carry deep grudges against dragons, and attack without pause any who cross into their territories.",

A hunting blood hag preys on unsuspecting neighbors during the night, sneaking into their homes and feeding off their blood or burning them alive. When a blood hag finds a particularly choice victim, she forgoes simply feeding on her, and instead abducts her, spiriting her away to the hag's hidden lair, where she'll be tortured and drained dry of blood over the course of days or weeks.

      "description": "When mortal humanoids find themselves exposed to profound, supernatural evil, a horrific, occult transformation can strip them of their souls and damn them to the tortured existence of a bodak. Changed into a twisted, misanthropic husk, a bodak wanders the endless tracts of evil-aligned planes, periodically stumbling into other realms by passing through portals or otherwise being conjured elsewhere. Possessing only fragmented memories of its former existence, the bodak is driven by profound emptiness, sorrowful longing, and vengeful hatred of all life.A bodak's appearance is profoundly disturbing. Its flesh looks dried, taut, and desiccated, though it possesses a strange, otherworldly sheen. Its body is disproportionate and distinctly androgynous. Hairless and with only vague hints of facial structure, the bodak's eyes are deep set in their sockets and constantly weep foul-smelling smoky vapors. A planes-wise traveler who recognizes its shape knows to flee, for most travelers can outrun the relatively slow bodak.Bodaks vehemently despise all living creatures and immediately seek to destroy any they encounter.A bodak retains the ability to speak one language it knew in life (typically Common), but it rarely engages in conversation, instead spitting out an incomprehensible stream of vile accusations, curses, and threats. On occasion, a bodak might wield weapons, but most rely primarily upon the effects of their deadly gaze.Bodaks are rarely encountered outside of the Abyss.As they are slow-witted, powerful evil creatures such as liches and nabasu demons sometimes use bodaks as thralls, assassins, or guardians. Bodaks encountered on the Material Plane exude extreme malevolence when forced to confront the realization of their abhorrent transformations. So great is their desire to inf lict their fate upon others that many attempt to drag off the bodies of their slain victims and guard them until they rise as undead.A 20th-level spellcaster can use create greater undead to create a bodak, but only if the spell is cast while the spellcaster is located on one of the evil outer planes (traditionally the Abyss).",

Born of ancient heresies mired amid the Styx-fed swamps of Stygia, Hell's fifth layer, bone devils-also known as osyluths-enforce infernal order and the will of the archdevils.Powerful fiends favor these terrifying sadists for their unwavering devotion to Hell's laws and the commands of their masters, as osyluths eagerly report the disobedience of other devils-regardless of standing-and take to the craft of torture like morbid artists. Diabolists risk much to bargain with them, as bone devils glean many infernal secrets amid their nightmarish calcified torture hives.These devils especially delight in journeying to the mortal plane, as their cruel talents and service to evil spellcasters often mean gaining much valuable information, which they might hold in their perfect memories for centuries before reporting back to their diabolical masters.In battle, an osyluth uses quickened invisibility after each attack to confuse foes. Many osyluths carry twisted and eerie bone weapons, but these tools are more for torture and intimidation than actual combat.Osyluths tower over lesser devils at 9 feet tall-though their tails and fearsome but useless wings make them appear much larger-and weigh upward of 400 pounds.",

Considerably more intelligent than their shambling mound cousins, they claim wide territories-typically swamps, forests, jungles, or other lands thick with plant-life-and brook no insult to their realm. Highly defensive of the life within their lands, especially plants and thinking plant creatures, borutas view themselves as the avengers of those that can't defend themselves, and mercilessly repay destructive invaders with verdurous force. On the rare occasions when they deal peaceably with non-plant creatures, borutas cover their frightening forms with thick veils of grass or peat moss.Borutas generally stand about 7 feet tall and weigh just over 200 pounds.",

Cocooned in a thick shell of reeds and swampy grasses, a boruta grows inside its own chamber until it reaches maturity, about 2 years after the emergence of the pod. Upon reaching this stage of maturity, a swamp lord breaks out of its protective shell fully grown.Though formidable upon emergence, infant borutas are incredibly vulnerable while developing in their cocoons.If the shell-like pod is ruptured before development is complete, the boruta within ceases to grow, usually causing it to simply wither away. Few can say where borutas come from, though some claim that natural lands threatened with destruction or with strong ties to the First World produce them.A boruta's viny flesh typically takes a greenish hue, though these colors change with the natural progression of the seasons or to otherwise blend in with the foliage of its homeland. As a boruta ages, its leaves continues to darken, and the most ancient swamp lords possess foliage almost as black as the murky waters from which they emerge. How long a boruta might survive, no one knows, as the reclusive creatures sometimes vanish into their fecund homes and aren't seen for decades. Some propose the creatures are immortal-or at least have life spans on par with the oldest trees-so long as the territory they watch over remains healthy.",

As sentient plants, borutas share kinship with the oldest trees and slightest blades of grass in their territories, viewing all as members of their extended family and watching over all. Their manner of thinking and philosophies differ wildly from these of humanoids, being far more fundamentally tied into the cycle of seasons and the mysterious rhythms of the earth. Borutas understand that nature is rarely calm or peaceful, and that the mere act of moving can often be disruptive or outright destructive to other organisms, yet do what they can to keep forces outside of nature from disturbing or destroying the environments of their homes.Left to their own devices, they tend to plants and vulnerable animals, commune with the oldest growth and natural creatures of their territories, and encourage new growth. Should their homes be violated, however, whether by the axes of enterprising humanoids or the depredations of rampaging monsters, borutas do all they can to prevent future harm. Sometimes this might mean slaying a dangerous interloper, but in more extreme cases their vengeance might launch an extended campaign of natural violence against an entire community. Borutas try not to harm the innocent, but if they view certain neighboring creatures as fundamentally destructive, or are forced to choose between the lives of invaders and those of their plants, they will always side with nature. Such decisions often put borutas at odds with expanding humanoid communities, leading to tales of violent swamp monsters or evil spirits of the forest, though rarely do such stories consider the plants' points of view. Borutas are intelligent enough to reason with, but are stolid in their defense of their lands and will no more accept partial loss or brook lessened defilement of their homes than a community might assent to the murder of a mere fraction of its populace.Borutas rarely encounter others of their kind, being born alone and never leaving their territories of their own accord. They typically find themselves at odds with humanoids, and even the most nature-sensitive elves often find them disagreeable or alien enough to bear avoidance. Druids who know of a boruta in a region typically go out of their way to placate it and serve as peacemakers between the swamp lord and the communities of other humanoids; they often preach avoidance to all who would pass through the proud plant creature's lands. Despite their similar interests in watching over nature, treants rarely share territories with borutas, preferring highly forested lands while the swamp lords tend to favor darker lands and the meaner plants of the forest. When members of the two races do share lands, they might brief ly cooperate in defense of their forest, though treants typically disfavor boruta tactics, which they view as shortsighted and provocative. Fey, too, have mixed opinions of borutas, with goodly fey avoiding them, while the more neutral hold them in high regard. Yet borutas share a special alliance with shambling mounds, treating the wild plants as primitive cousins, often assembling and guiding tribelike communities of the mounds and cooperating with them to drive off those who threaten their lands.",

The creature's thought patterns are unusually powerful, and cause painful mental feedback in the minds of other conscious beings. Other intelligent beings are nothing more than cattle and playthings to brain oozes-victims to be tormented, thought patterns to be consumed. Brain oozes prefer to manipulate their prey from the shadows. Rather than assaulting openly, they provoke fights and conf lict within groups, or lure one or two victims away for the kill. Brain oozes derive particular satisfaction from forcing an individual to commit terrible acts, then wiping away all knowledge of the crimes from the victim's memory. They torment such hapless puppets again and again, forcing them to commit ever greater atrocities. Once weary of their sport they return the modified memories with dispel magic, and feast upon the delicious misery of the victim's final despair. Brain oozes feed through their tentacles by extracting the thoughts of living creatures. Animals and less intelligent creatures provide little nourishment, but they prize fey, outsiders, and spellcasters as delicacies. After several feedings, a brain ooze divides into two nearly identical brains, each retaining only a portion of the knowledge and experiences of the parent. The similarities between intellect devourers and brain oozes have not gone unnoticed, but the two species appear to have little in common beyond appearance. Some theorize that brain oozes are actually the result of an ancient race's failed attempt to achieve immortality by preserving their minds via alien technology or magic.",

      "description": "The creation of some unknown arcanist in millennia past, the bulette has bred true to become one of the fiercest predators of the hills. Burrowing rapidly through the earth just beneath the surface, sometimes with its armored fin cutting a distinctive wake behind it, the bulette launches itself free of stone and soil to tear into its prey without remorse, giving rise to the common appellation \"landshark.\" Bulettes are notoriously foul-tempered, attacking far larger creatures with no regard for personal safety.Solitary beasts except for the occasional mated pair, they spend most of their time patrolling the perimeters of territories that can stretch up to 30 square miles, hunting game and punishing interlopers with a fury that shakes the hillsides.Bulettes are perfect eating machines, consuming bones, armor, and even magical items with their powerful jaws and churning stomach acid. Lacking other food, the bulette might gnaw on inanimate objects, yet for unknown reasons no bulette voluntarily consumes elf flesh-a peccadillo many point to as evidence that elven wizardry was involved in its creation. Dwarves are also rarely eaten by the beasts, though the bulette still slaughters members of either race on sight. Half lings, on the other hand, are among the beast's favorite meals, and no half ling with any sense ventures into bulette country casually.The bulette is a cunning fighter, surprising foes with its impressive agility. One of its favorite tactics is to charge forward and launch itself into the air in order to drop on its prey with all four razor-sharp claws extended.Folklore claims that the flesh behind the beast's dorsal crest is particularly tender, and that those willing and able to wait until the fin is raised in the excitement of combat or mating can target it for a killing blow-yet most who have faced the landshark agree that the best way to win a fight with a bulette is to avoid it entirely.",

Camulatz also have a special affinity for sounds, naturally mimicking voices and animal noises, while perfecting the magical ability to displace such sounds, making them seem to emanate from other creatures or objects. Camulatz delight in using both their magical ventriloquism and their beautiful plumage to mislead and separate victims before surprising them with diving attacks from above.All camulatz possess sharp talons on their feet, capable of rending the most heavily armored foes, but they rely on their cruelly curved beaks to decapitate their victims.The vivid patterns of a camulatz's feathers also provide some protection to the birds, forming a magical field of clashing colors that can def lect ranged attacks.A mature camulatz is just over 14 feet in length from its beak to the ends of its tail feathers, but weighs only 300 pounds because of its lightweight bone structure.Each individual camulatz bears its own unique feather coloration, which it can consciously manipulate in set patterns to produce its hypnotic display.",

Thereafter, camulatz save their victims' skulls as trophies, using them as tribute to Pazuzu, ornamentation for their nests, and markers for the bounds of their territory and favored hunting grounds.While camulatz never forget which individual is responsible for harvesting a given skull, most groups prefer to store their skulls communally, as they believe that their demonic patron finds more appeal in a single titanic collection of skulls than many small individual ones. As such, each aerie has a central altar where skulls are stacked in order of ascending prominence. This location, known as the Place of Screeching, is often used as a meeting place or the location for important rituals, and powerful females may occasionally choose to mate directly upon the altar in the hope that Pazuzu will notice and, in his demonic voyeurism, provide the resulting offspring with fiendish boons. For both genders, however, providing the skull that crowns the altar's tower is a lifelong goal for every individual.Camulatz mate only once a year, or even less, usually with different partners on each occasion. During mating cycles, female camulatz use their hypnotic display ability to lure and seduce their chosen mates, mating frantically and violently with the entranced, nearly helpless males.Afterward, females lay 1-3 eggs, which they jealously guard thereafter-even driving away the fathers-until the eggs hatch in about 3 months. Females communally raise their young for 2 years until the hatchlings reach adulthood, at which point the fully grown camulatz separate according to gender-the males band together to hunt and raid, while the females establish new aeries to maintain and defend.Camulatz have lifespans of 80 to 100 years, and though they have no written histories or oral legends beyond the braggadocio of individual members, their memories are long, and a camulatz never forgets a slight or the face of a prey animal that got away.",

Meanwhile, female camulatz rule over the larger aeries, safeguarding their eggs and hatchlings. Both genders are equally violent and capable in combat.Camulatz believe they are the chosen followers of Pazuzu, revering the demon prince in all they do. They view the act of decapitation as a holy sacrifice to Pazuzu, and their faith requires them to appease their demon lord by sacrificing a sentient creature at least once per month.Camulatz believe that consuming a creature's head gives them some measure of the victim's power-hence the reason for preying on intelligent creatures rather than simple beasts-and that these ritual feedings attract the favor of their demon lord.Camulatz bear a special hatred for monstrous humanoids and worshipers of Lamashtu, taking up the same battle waged between Pazuzu and the Mother of Monsters. As such, the skulls of gnolls, monkey goblins, and jungle harpies are especially prized by camulatz, and frequently decorate their lairs. Some Mwangi tribes even appease camulatz by offering them such captives in exchange for safe travel through the camulatz's territory or safety from predation, though any deals made with the notoriously fickle bird people are tenuous at best. Many are the tribes who thought to purchase their safety with slaves and sacrifices, only to find their members' own skulls mounted among the sacrifices in the camulatz's Place of Screeching.",

It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center mass, which also conceals a large, beaklike maw. The canopy creeper can spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak exposed. The actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total.

            "description": "Canopy creepers are plants naturally evolved to take advantage of their surroundings. They grow amid the lush foliage of jungles or rain forests where a diverse array of vine plants proliferates. The canopy creeper climbs up among the tree tops and intertwines its own vine-grown body with those that grow naturally, enabling it to gain control over the naturally occurring network of vines to use as a source of both defense and sustenance. While a canopy creeper does gain food and energy from photosynthesis, it cannot maintain its active metabolism when relying only on the nutrients gleaned from sun and rain. For maximum efficiency, it uses the vine tendrils that it gains control of to detect by scent, to entrap, and to draw prey toward itself. It is also able to use these vine tendrils to procure food as they draw the nutrient-rich fluids from creatures entangled within their embrace, which are then conveyed back to the controlling canopy creeper. While the canopy creeper's primary method of attack is through its vine tendrils, it does have a large beak mouth composed of a hard, hornlike material. This beak is normally concealed within the center of its vine mass, but when creatures approach that prove able to resist its vine tendril attacks, the canopy creeper tries to draw them in close enough so that it can attack with its beak as well. It can consume prey with this mouth, but this is not its preferred method of feeding as most of the prey's fluids are lost as the beak tears the creature apart, resulting in fewer nutrients than if it were to feed solely through the vine tendrils. A canopy creeper naturally mimics the appearance and growth of the types of vines that grow in its environment, so when one is concealed among the vine-tangled foliage above, it is difficult for even an experienced outdoorsman to detect. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is usually hanging about 100 feet above the ground, making its appearance even more difficult to discern. Canopy creepers' preferred prey is Medium or larger creatures since these tend to hold more of the nutrient-rich fluids that the creepers feed upon; meanwhile, Small and smaller creatures-such as small monkeys-can often be seen cavorting around and even suspended from a canopy creeper, oblivious to its presence. However, during starvation conditions when the creeper is forced to rely upon photosynthesis for its survival, it readily preys upon such smaller creatures as well. The result of this preference, however, is that the canopy creature typically focuses its attacks on opponents of at least Medium size. Canopy creepers store a great deal of moisture from their normally wet habitat in their vine structures, making them difficult to burn. However, this fact, as well as their adaptation to warm climates, makes them particularly susceptible to cold attacks, which cause them to become brittle and prone to fractures in their vine structures.",

The creature relies on the prolific presence of other vine growths to camouf lage its presence and to provide an aerial habitat from which it can feed safely above most creatures that might prey upon it. As a result, if a canopy creeper is caught on the ground away from screening foliage, it flies into a berserk frenzy, lashing out with its beak as it attempts to make for the nearest tree or high ground to escape. A well-fed canopy creeper buds once every 4 or 5 years and drops dozens of small seedlings to the ground. Most of these shrivel up and die from lack of sustenance, but one or two usually manage to survive on rats and other vermin until they grow large and strong enough to become mobile, a process that usually takes about a month. These seedlings then instinctively begin looking for a new hunting area away from their parents and siblings, since the plants are naturally solitary and avoid encroaching on each other's hunting territory. A successful seedling reaches full size in 2-3 years if it finds a location with suitable prey to feed upon. During the time when the plants are seedlings, opportunistic horticulturists have been known to contain and transport canopy creepers, transplanting them elsewhere and raising them as potent guardian plant creatures.",

They wander the planes in search of new facts and concepts to add to the pulsating brain-sacks that serve as their collective memories. When a band of caulborn find a particularly interesting site, they settle down to dwell there for many years until they feel that they have learned all there is to know about the location. A caulborn is literally a creature of the mind. Its body is self-sustaining, and it exists solely to record and catalogue new thoughts. While they are not evil, caulborn have little interest in alliances or friendship with other races.",

To benign passersby, these marble constructs remain inert, their stone gazes producing only an unnerving sense of watchfulness. However, those who attempt to raid or desecrate a cephalophore's holy site quickly find that the seemingly immovable statue is anything but. Consequently, many adventurers and tomb raiders have come to see cephalophores as good omens, for when one finds a cephalophore, a dangerous and treasure-filled ruin-hopefully still unlooted-is surely not far away. Each cephalophore was constructed to stand guard over a single location, typically a tomb or temple. The ravages of time do little to diminish the single-minded dedication of these creatures, but the sacred edifices to which they are bound seldom stand so firmly against the ages. Thus, cephalophores are often found amid ruins or deep in the wilderness, standing vigilant guard over a site long forgotten by mortal society. Many cephalophores lie buried beneath sandy dunes, overgrown by unchecked jungle foliage, or entombed within collapsed caverns. A typical cephalophore stands 10 to 15 feet tall and weighs 4,000 pounds. Cephalophores are made of solid marble, which makes attacking them with standard weaponry inefficient at best. <br/></br>",

A creature cursed with an amorphous body becomes a spongy, shapeless mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape constantly melts, flows, writhes, and boils. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, helmets, and rings become useless. Large items worn or carried-armor, backpacks, even shirts-hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Speed is reduced to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. The victim gains the amorphous quality, but cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). A victim can temporarily regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Will save (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. Spells that change the victim's shape (such as alter self, beast shape, elemental body, and polymorph) do not remove the curse, but hold the creature in a stable form (which might not be its own form, depending on the spell) and prevent additional Wisdom drain for the duration of the spell; shapechange and stoneskin have a similar effect. The victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock every round that it ends its turn in an amorphous shape-upon being drained to 1 Wisdom, further Wisdom drain ceases and the amorphous body effect is permanent until removed via magic (no further number of saving throws can cure the condition at this time).",

These xenophobic humanoids rarely venture far from their domains, settling in small tribes and building rocky huts underwater or muddy domes along the subterranean shore. A typical charda stands just under 4 feet tall but weighs 250 pounds. Chardas reproduce by laying eggs in small clutches of two to four, which they bury among rocks offshore. Females fiercely protect their own clutches, but show no predisposition toward protecting the clutches of other chardas, even those within their tribe. Devoutly religious, chardas prefer to worship gods of war or cold. They hunt in small packs composed of both males and females. Hunting and slaying help determine an individual's power within the group. Chardas often engage in infanticide and cannibalism. While they patrol their territories in groups, they fight individually with little strategy or structure. Chardas do not assist each other with their kills, as they perceive aid as a weakness and a dishonor to both themselves and their foes.",

Yet Hell cares nothing for the souls that toil and suffer within its depths, all being fodder for the infinite exertions of the infernal machine. As frightened souls suffer over centuries of horror, losing what once existed of their individuality, those rightfully damned to the Pit join with the fundament of that realm, supplying the infernal realm with the terrible sustenance it requires to- over the span of eons-excrete forth mindless lemures. Yet souls not meant for Hell fail to sustain the plane, collecting in mindless spirit cancers of primal pain and blind rage. From these cysts of wrathful, unrighteous damnation, the powers of Hell forge chains in the shape of terrible armor, creating within gigantic, barely restrained beings of hatred and living hellfire, and turn them toward the enemies of the infernal realm. These towering blasphemies are the chortovs.</br>Despite being unwilling servants of devilkind, chortovs are irretrievable prisoners of Hell. As the processes by which the infernal realm torments, destroys, and refines souls into the stuff of fiends last for innumerable centuries, and as untold numbers of the damned comprise a single devil, no remnant of individual lives, ambition, or memory remains within these gigantic terrors. Yet despite a lack of specifics, all chortovs are consumed by an overwhelming understanding that they are slaves to a hated master and the impotent knowledge that, for all their might and wrath, the one thing they can never strike against is their captors.

While such conflicts never come to blows-the chortovs restricted by their armor from defying the will of Hell-the distraction typically overshadows any benefit gained by their tandem efforts. As such, chortovs typically work alongside diabolical keepers, devils with the desires of Hell and its lords intrinsic to their beings. These minders typically come from the ranks of lesser devils, specifically ordered to direct the ferocious destructive might of these gigantic fiends.

Once they seize their victims, chuuls often drag grappled foes back into deep water to drown them.Lizardfolk are by far the chuul's favorite prey, though those pale chuul breeds that live underground prefer morlocks, duergar, unwary drow, and other unfortunates who get too close to their subterranean waterways-with the exception of troglodytes, whose flavor chuuls find particularly offensive.Chuuls are surprisingly intelligent, leading many to speculate fruitlessly on their origins and motivations.They speak a chittering, burbling dialect of Common, but few are inclined to speak to those outside their race, and if chuul society exists beyond their frenzied mating season, humanoids have yet to record it. Instead, chuul intellects seem entirely devoted to seeking out the perfect ambush sites to attack other intelligent creatures and decorating their elaborate lairs with trophies from their kills. Though the chuuls themselves seem uninterested in using tools of any kind, they have an almost compulsive need to collect keepsakes from their victims.A typical chuul is 8 feet tall and weighs 650 pounds.",

Broad-shouldered, with features as sharp as chiseled stone, cliff giants can reach a height of 14 feet and weigh over 1,300 pounds. As if sculpted from layers of stone, cliff giants' skin color is a deep reddish brown, with quartz-like streaks or veins of color that crisscross in shades of ivory, dull yellow, or bright white. Cliff giants live up to 800 years old. Although kind, cliff giants prefer solitude and spend their lives in seclusion from other humanoids to form a stronger bond with the natural world. This bond often leads them to see large expanses of land as their responsibility and all living things within as their charges. Many track cycles of the weather, animal migrations, and the lairs of dangerous monsters by painting elaborate pictograms on high cliff walls. Cliff giant family units stay together for about a decade, after which time children live with one parent or the other until fully grown and able to survive on their own (at about 20 years old). Marital bonds between cliff giants are strong despite their inclination for solitude; a married pair of cliff giants may raise and bear children in this way once every century, and when living apart they communicate with each other on a monthly basis using animal messengers. Cliff giants respect their elders, and some pairs living together are an adult giant with an old parent or grandparent.",

      "description": "Coven oozes result from a hag eye ooze's conglomeration of multiple hag eyes, often caused by the destruction of a hag coven with a hag eye ooze nearby. With its controller gone, and no one to provide food, the ooze feeds upon its mistress and her coven sisters. Through this consumption, the creation gains some semblance of its creators' cunning, independent thought, and malignancy. If the coven sisters had hag eyes of their own, the ooze absorbs them into its form. Otherwise, consumption of the coven, with the residual magic of the original hag eye, transforms one eye from each of the hags in the coven into a functional hag eye. A coven ooze wanders its creator's territory, devouring any living organism it comes upon. With their animal intelligence, they use the terrain to their best advantage, often lying in waterways near frequented river crossings. Coven oozes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh roughly 1,500 pounds, although larger specimens have been encountered. When a coven ooze comes across another creature with the ooze subtype, it attempts to engulf and consume it. For every 10 HD of ooze creatures that a coven ooze consumes, its size increases by one step, to a maximum size of Gargantuan. If a coven ooze ever consumes a hag eye ooze, the creator of the hag eye ooze-if a hag-must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or have her connection to the hag eye ooze severed.",

      "description": "Perhaps the least leonine of all sphinxes, the ram-headed criosphinx lacks the intellect of androsphinxes and gynosphinxes, but still outmatches the dim-witted hieracosphinxes. Like hieracosphinxes and androsphinxes, criosphinxes are always male. At the start of a battle, a criosphinx lowers its horns and crashes into foes, clawing enemies it has engaged. It favors charging down on foes from great heights. Criosphinxes crave wealth over nearly all other things, habitually extorting tolls for safe passage from any who pass their lands. Groups who cannot pay must yield one of their number or a pair of mounts for the criosphinx's meal- single travelers must fight or die. Unlike gynosphinxes, no mere riddle suffices-only the shine of metal or the gleam of jewels can satisfy a criosphinx. Little can convince a criosphinx to part with even a single coin save the lust that its kind bears for the gynosphinx. Criosphinxes crave mating with gynosphinxes above all else, and pay well for the whereabouts of a female, or better yet, a well-crafted riddle that might impress one. For their part, gynosphinxes prefer to have little to do with what they mock as the sheep of sphinxes, though they sometimes lower themselves to a brief assignation in the rare event a criosphinx manages to impress them with wealth or wit. Some criosphinxes set themselves as soothsayers of the desert, trading upon the storied wisdom of androsphinxes and gynosphinxes to deceive gullible travelers. Like their more blustering brethren, they seek wealth from passersby, but for the purposes of dispersing information rather than in exchange for safe passage. Such reliable information as they possess usually comes from idle conversation with the creatures of the desert, with criosphinxes using their inborn ability to speak with animals. A criosphinx lacking in sound information usually fabricates a pleasing lie. Criosphinxes detest hieracosphinxes, regarding them as little more than beasts and a disgrace to their noble race. They drive off their falcon-headed cousins with mock-charges and posturing, escalating to full-f ledged attacks if ignored. Androsphinxes they view with mixed fear and respect, and gynosphinxes with disdain and lust.",

      "description": "Dark nagas covet luxury, wealth, and power over others. With bodies covered by shimmering, eel-like black scales, dark nagas slither deftly through forsaken lands and abandoned ruins, scouring such places for treasures and weaker creatures they might force into service. Their forked tongues spread only lies, and others whom they can't manipulate they destroy with their insidious poison and destructive magical abilities. A typical dark naga measures approximately 12 feet long and weighs upward of 300 pounds. Arrogant and sybaritic, dark nagas seek to dominate lesser creatures, relishing the fear they inspire and power over other beings. While some manage to carve indulgent fiefdoms from tribes of goblins, orcs, lizardfolk, or other barbarous races, the luster of cosmopolitan fineries proves enticing as well, leading some to infiltrate city sewers and slums to gather an urban following. They particularly relish morbidly crafted jewelry and treasures, often adorning themselves with jeweled bands or taking their ease atop piles of treasure. Dark nagas hate others of their kind, especially other dark nagas, seeing their brethren as deadly opponents to be dispatched swiftly and mercilessly-often rightly so.",

      "description": "A deathtrap ooze is a disgusting mass of brown-orange sludge that moves and hunts of its own volition. It exists only to feed. Thought to be related to ochre jellies, the deathtrap ooze is up to 12 feet wide and 6 inches deep in its normal, mobile form. While moving, it shrinks a foot or two in width, gaining about 6 inches of height, and rolls forward in a quivering mass. Deathtrap oozes are less inclined to look for prey than are other oozes-they prefer to hunt by ambush. Their ability to assume the form of simple mechanical traps has long intrigued scholars, but this ability is not something born out of intellect as much as by supernatural cunning. A deathtrap ooze lacks any creative ability-it can only mimic traps that it has encountered during its wanderings, and even then, the repertoire of trap designs it can draw upon is limited to just the last few it has encountered. These oozes surely have an origin rooted in magical meddling. Countless ancient crypts have such oozes within, lurking patiently in ageless trap form, awaiting would-be tomb-raiders for a first-in-centuries breakfast. Those who have studied the deathtrap ooze suppose that wizards of some lost culture altered ochre jellies into perfect guardians. Like ochre jellies, elder deathtrap oozes can grow to be enormous. Rumor holds that some can also duplicate even more complex traps that release toxic fumes, spray acid, or contain poison. Some even claim there are oozes so huge that they can duplicate traps that fill entire rooms with multiple moving parts.",

This crocodilian possesses a shorter, rounder snout than the typical crocodile, and thus resembles a giant alligator. A patient hunter, the deinosuchus is all but invisible beneath the surface of the water. Only its nostrils breach the water's surface, allowing the rest of its formidable mass to remain out of sight from even highly perceptive prey. In combat, the deinosuchus grinds its prey between its powerful jaws, knocking back other foes with its formidable tail while it snaps bones and tears the flesh of its captured meal.",

The denizens of Leng can travel to other planes freely, and often do so in strange, black ships, constantly seeking new breeds of slaves or trading rubies for unusual services or magical treasures.At other times, their visits are much more violent, focusing on abducting victims for use as slaves or worse. On Leng, these denizens have long fought a war against that realm's monstrous spiders, a war that sometimes spills over into other worlds.A denizen of Leng weighs 200 pounds and stands roughly 5-1/2 feet tall.",

These fierce, ambush predators hunt by finding high perches among rocky outcroppings and surveying their surroundings. When likely prey wanders into sight, a desert drake dives into the sand and burrows toward its quarry or flies low with cover from dunes or other outcroppings. Drawing near the likely path of its victims, it bursts from the sand or dives from above to catch foes off guard, preferring to attack targets that exhibit the most fear first. Before enemies can recover from the initial onslaught, a desert drake exhales a cloud of electrified dust, using its superior senses to press the attack. Mated pairs of desert drakes hunt larger prey and groups of victims, and rampages of the beasts might gather near overland trade routes to devour whole caravans. A typical desert drake measures 15 feet long from nose to tail tip, has a supple, wormlike build, and weighs about 2,500 pounds.",

Desert giants stand 15 feet tall on average, but have slender builds and rarely weigh more than 2,000 pounds, a fact that greatly contributes to their grace and speed. The giants favor loose robes with keffiyehs for protection from the scouring desert winds, as well as traveling leathers worn beneath the robes. They require little water, and are able to survive for as long as 2 weeks on food alone. When such goods are available, they drink water, milk, and juices in prodigious amounts, but they spurn beer, wine, and stronger spirits. The bulk of their diet comes from figs, olives, and similar bounty of the oases, supplemented by meat if required. The eldest desert giants live as long as 300 years. Despite their nomadic ways, desert giants guard their territory fiercely, driving away all interlopers, whether intelligent or bestial.",

      "description": "A desert hermit seeks the solitude in the windswept wastes for two chief reasons. First, the hermit finds that isolation allows him to more easily experience nature's harsh beauty and raw power, which he seeks to emulate. Second, the wide open spaces provide the hermit with the freedom to experience the world without interference from human society, which is trapped in meaningless competitions to get ahead in a race toward an unhappy death plagued by debt, troublesome relationships, and arbitrary expectations enforced by shame, discrimination, and even violence. Desert hermits are often defensive and suspicious when interrupted by outsiders. They rarely form druid circles, preferring true isolation. Those who forgo their connection to the desert in favor of a bestial ally tend to select camels, cobras, jackals, and vultures.",

It has no eyes, and is completely blind, but possesses a pair of complex, tripartite ears it can adjust to different levels of sensitivity to sound, allowing the destrachan to hunt in absolute darkness as if it were able to see.Destrachans are carnivores, preferring to stalk and kill live prey, although they also feast on carrion. This habit serves them well, since they often kill more than they can immediately consume. They often hunt in packs, using a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles to communicate with each other. While destrachans cannot speak, they are capable of understanding spoken languages like the common tongue, and often take pleasure in their victims' cries and pleas for mercy.",

Alternatively, the destrachan can target a single crystal, metal, stone, or wooden object within 80 feet with this attack-that object takes 8d6 points of damage. This damage is not halved when applied to the object's hit points, but is reduced by the object's hardness. A magical or attended object can attempt a DC 19 Reflex save to halve the damage.

With its ability to shift planes, it is no stranger to the weirdest the Great Beyond has to offer, and despite its brutish and unrefined intellect, its knowledge of the planes and the relationships between dimensions is significant indeed.A dimensional shambler is humanoid in outline, yet it moves with a weird and alien gait that gives it the appearance of a creature not in full possession of its faculties, almost as if it were drunk or horribly wounded. Yet those who mistake this shambling posture as a sign of weakness swiftly learn of their error, for the dimensional shambler is in fact quite agile-the weird lumbering cadence of its movements is simply another outward manifestation of its inhuman countenance.A dimensional shambler typically stands just over 7 feet in height, and weighs 350 pounds.",

            "description": "As outsiders, dimensional shamblers have no need to feed-a trait that comes in handy for a creature that often finds itself adrift or lost in strange realms where food and water does not-or perhaps cannot-exist. They are certainly most at home in regions that function similarly to most Material Plane worlds, for their bodies are built to traverse the ground. They have no inborn ability to fly, cannot breathe water, and possess no unusual resistance to energies, and as such there are many realms throughout the Great Beyond that are dangerous or even deadly to dimensional shamblers. Yet they are masters of traveling the planes, and instinctively avoid appearing in regions that would cause them harm. More powerful dimensional shamblers often seek out magical devices to aid them in traveling the stranger and less hospitable corners of reality.The need a dimensional shambler has for exploring the Great Beyond is not fully understood by mortal scholars. Certainly, curiosity seems to be a large part of their drive-a dimensional shambler can spend weeks or even years simply observing a particularly unusual planar feature, such as the expulsion of raw protolife from the Positive Energy Plane into the surrounding realities, the strange semianimate heavings of an Abyssal swamp giving birth to a legion of demons, or the mind-numbing violence of a reality storm deep in the Maelstrom. As chaotic evil outsiders, they are most comfortable on planes that either have no strong alignment traits or are close to chaotic evil, yet this does not prevent them from exploring realms beyond.The mind of a dimensional shambler, as with its body and mobility, is not quite \"in tune\" with mortal expectations, and it may be that what scholars have assumed is curiosity could be some other driving force. Perhaps the race instinctively travels the Great Beyond in search of a forgotten or hidden goal, or maybe the constant change of reality is something that brings them pleasure or some strange nutrition.Dimensional shamblers generally lack the wits to carry on long philosophical discussions, and are prone to attacking other creatures when they encounter them, so attempts to learn more about this mysterious race through conversation have not resulted in particularly informative results.",

            "description": "Dimensional shamblers seem to have very little interest in others of their kind. While they do not display any instinctual need for violence against others of their ilk when chance brings them together, neither do they seek out their own kind for companionship.Dimensional shamblers are solitary beings, and the majority of their interactions with other forms of life are violent- they are fond of snatching creatures who are capable of comprehending their own peril and whisking them away to remote corners of the multiverse.Those few who have endured these abductions and survived to tell the tale did so either by escaping their captors and hiding, or by slaying the shamblers. In all cases, their return home has involved harrowing journeys through the Great Beyond, for the dimensional shambler is frustratingly skilled at selecting particularly remote and dangerous realms as destinations for its abductions. The fate of the majority of these victims is unknown, although circumstantial evidence indicates that the shambler itself plays a key and grisly role in the victims' doom.Spellcasters have long sought to harness the dimensional shambler's ability to accurately travel between planes.Mortal magic has traditionally found this feat a difficult one to master-plane shift is notorious for its inaccuracy, often leaving powerful effects like gate, miracle, or wish as the favored methods of safe interplanar travel. Yet the dimensional shambler seems able to navigate the unnavigable with ease, traveling between incredibly diverse and distant locations with no more difficulty than a human might have stepping out of a house into his own front yard. Unfortunately, the same mastery over dimensional travel that affords shamblers such accurate navigation allows them to resist the call of conjurers with surprising skill.In fact, by the time most spellcasters master the magic required to lure or conjure a dimensional shambler, it is often a simpler matter to use a gate spell instead.Some conjurers claim to have developed methods of attracting dimensional shamblers more easily.Through the use of blood sacrifice via a blade of purest metal and the application of exacting mathematical symbols or other complex combinations of runes, these spellcasters can call upon dimensional shamblers with relative ease. Unfortunately, the exact combination of runes, metals, and bloodshed seems different for every dimensional shambler, so once a spellcaster discovers the correct combination to lure one of these monsters, the secret that caster has uncovered is as closely guarded as her greatest treasures. The nature and availability of these secret rituals are left to the GM to determine, but such a ritual's recipe could well be worth 8,000 gp or more to an interested party.",

      "description": "Tigers stand more than 3 feet tall at the shoulder and are about 9 feet long. They weigh from 400 to 600 pounds. Tigers are usually the top animal predators in their territories, and have been known to kill bears, crocodiles, giant snakes, wolves, and even other great cats. Even humanoids are far from safe, especially in cases where a tiger has developed a taste for humanoid flesh. Tigers prefer terrain with plenty of cover and proximity to water as their hunting grounds. While the tiger itself is a fearsome predator, its strength and ferocity pales in comparison to that of the larger dire tiger. Known to many scholars as the smilodon and to tribal societies as the saber-toothed tiger, the dire tiger is invariably one of the region's top predators. Its defining feature is a pair of huge incisors that hang down like fearsome knives from the upper jaw, protruding menacingly even when the creature's mouth is shut. These immense hunting cats grow to be over 12 feet long and can weigh up to 6,000 pounds.",

If a dosojin instead chooses to hinder travelers, it creates unexpected twists and turns within its ward, turning the path into difficult terrain and so causing travelers to take twice as long as they normally would to reach their destination.

A dosojin gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks when imitating a statue in this manner.<br/>Dosojins are kami that take the form of stone icons and watch over roads and trails. They are often found in statue form at the edges of villages, along mountain passes, at the beginnings of tunnels and other major works of roadway construction, or at simple country crossroads. In urban areas, dosojins can sometimes be found on street corners and near bridges. They serve as the guardians of travelers, keeping the malicious and malevolent off the paths they diligently watch over. Wise travelers know to seek a dosojin's blessing before traveling upon its ward, for falling out of favor with the kami of travel is a sure way to become lost or hampered. Pious mortal couples also seek out dosojin for their own reasons, as the kami are often regarded as patrons of fertility, and are known for their habit of choosing mates and standing beside one another for their entire lives. In many regions, the blessing of a dosojin is believed to ensure a long and happy marriage, as well as many healthy children.

Dosojins spend most of their time guarding their chosen sites in the form of nondescript statues and way markers, meditating motionlessly for seasons at a time. While semi-social dosojins within cities and other settlements are not uncommon, the majority of these kami stand along remote and secluded roads, going to great lengths to ensure that their true identity is not known. It is not uncommon for dosojins to create false duplicates of themselves using their stone shape ability, and these misleading markers inspire a certain amount of faith among those who look out for the kami of roads, as one can rarely tell if a sculpture is a dosojin by looks alone. A dosojin requires no sustenance, but it is not uncommon for travelers to leave offerings for a silent watcher, usually tributes of fruits, nuts, and potables, gifts that the kami gladly shares with hungry travelers, happy to inspire such good faith among passersby and to foster a system of give-and-take between strangers. Dosojins are fond of the creatures that traverse their roads and trails, and maintain the roadways they guard to ensure both the ward's survival and the safe travel of the voyagers that traverse it. Though they have an aff inity for the creatures that constructed their roadways, dosojins still protect their wards with the aggressive righteousness typical of all kami, and scarcely hesitate when faced with an oni or other evildoer seeking to disrupt the balance. Dosojin have little patience for those who litter on their roadways or unnecessarily obstruct the paths, and they take it upon themselves to discipline those they deem worthy of punishment. Rarely violent in an overt sense, dosojins prefer to use their magic in order to trick travelers into becoming lost, letting the wilds they travel through become the primary instruments of their demise. Dosojins prove quite deadly to those who fail to show kami proper respect, as they use their powers of illusion to lead troublesome caravans into impassible ravines and destructive oni onto unsound, derelict bridges.",

            "description": "Dosojins are odd among kami in that they are known to select mates from among their own kind, and it is not uncommon to see two seemingly redundant statues standing next to one another near a trailhead or fork in the road. While they do not reproduce in any typical sense of the word, dosojins are nonetheless sought out by mortal couples hoping to conceive, as many people see the kami as symbols of fertility. However, most scholars agree that dosojins do not collaborate in this way to foster fecundity, but rather act as symbols of camaraderie and companionship for travelers on their roads, encouraging teamwork and cooperation among groups of diverse individuals with a shared goal. While most dosojins are content to watch over particular highways or roads for their entire existences and act as helpful guardians for most passersby, some choose instead to act as appraisers of travelers' skills and bravery. Cunning individuals that indulge in acts of trickery more often than their tamer brethren, these rogue dosojins craft obstacles and trials for travelers they deem worthy of the challenge. The tests are not meant to substantially impede voyagers, and are simply forms of innocent fun that a dosojin uses to gauge the strength and resolve of various wayfarers. Those who surpass a dosojin's challenges (which usually take the form of puzzles or illusions) earn the kami's respect and the assurance of safe travel throughout the rest of its domain, while those who avoid the obstacle or overcome it through brutish and witless means garner only scorn. Careful travelers know to watch out for the statuelike kami when making their way along potentially protected roads, as the guardians expect voyagers to act honorably and respectfully while travelling upon their paths. Some of the most important mandates to keep in mind when interacting with dosojin and walking through their territories are as follows. <ul><li> Mortals who respect the land and its laws shall know no harm. <li> Mortals who fail to show proper reverence for tradition shall not pass by a dosojin upon the first attempt. <li> Mortals who actively harm the natural world shall be cursed to wander it. <li> Mortals who stray from a dosojin's path to do harm should not expect to find that path ever again.</li></li></li></li></ul>",

These noble creatures gain their name from their ability to fly through the air without wings and to create different effects with their misty breath.Dragon horses are solitary creatures, spending most of their time up among the clouds and rarely setting hoof to solid ground. A mated pair of dragon horses remains together to raise its young, but otherwise individuals prefer to be on their own. They are fierce and reclusive, but peaceful and even playful under the right circumstances. Dragon horses sometimes offer aid and assistance to decent folk in need, taking care to use their ability to know alignment to avoid accidentally providing aid to evil creatures, whom they despise.Dragon horse foals are highly prized as potential steeds, but as dragon horses are highly intelligent creatures, they cannot be trained as if they were animals. Instead, one who seeks a dragon horse mount must use diplomacy to secure the creature's aid.Peaceful creatures by nature, dragon horses prefer to avoid combat by flying away. When they are forced to fight (often in response to an evil creature's mayhem), they attempt to deal nonlethal damage to all but evil-aligned foes, leaving any unconscious opponents unharmed. Those who have chosen evil ways may sometimes receive the same mercy, in the hope that it helps them see the light, but innately evil foes are dispatched as quickly and cleanly as possible.",

      "description": "Dragon turtles make their homes in both salt and fresh water, where they rank among the biggest threats to sailors and those who travel by ship through the waterways of the world. Skilled mariners know the territory dragon turtles claim and frequently make offerings of gold and magic for safe passage or avoid the area entirely. For its part, a dragon turtle quickly grows to appreciate and even expect such tithes and gifts, and a dragon turtle that expects gifts but is ignored is a dangerous foe indeed.A dragon turtle's shell varies in color between individuals. Some have dull shells of brown and rust red, while others have carapaces of a deep green-blue color with silver highlights across the rocky ridges. The coloration of the head, tail, and legs is slightly paler than the shell and contains golden streaks along the crest and spines.Dragon turtles claim vast territories in the open seas, encompassing regions often in excess of 50 square miles.Here, these dangerous beasts capsize ships that fail to respect their territories, adding the sunken wrecks and their valuable cargoes to their lairs. Dragon turtles generally make their homes in deep caves only accessible through the water, and often decorate their lairs not only with the wealth seized from ships they've sunk, but the wrecks of these unfortunate ships themselves. Their territorial natures and fondness for these types of lairs put them in direct conf lict with other undersea races such as merfolk and sahuagin.Large fish, such as tuna, sturgeons, and even sharks, rank among dragon turtles' favorite foods, but being omnivores, they also sometimes feed on large undersea fields of seaweed. They certainly aren't above supplementing their diets with the passengers of ships they sink, although such feeding is not borne of any intrinsic evil or cruelty. Dragon turtles possess shells 15 feet in diameter, with their appendages stretching a few feet further, and measure over 25 feet long from the tip of their noses to the ends of their powerful tails.",

Unlike many other dragons, dragonkin have enough dexterity in their front limbs to have adopted weapons, favoring huge glaives and long lances. The most unique aspect of dragonkin is their bond with other races. Dragonkin opposed to the depredations of evil dragons in the Drakelands recognize other cultures' potential, and such individuals often adopt humanoid riders. After it comes of age, a dragonkin may form an unbreakable partnership with a rider, who acts as a trusted comrade. In battle, a rider and her dragon are inseparable, in such constant telepathic communication that they almost seem to be one entity. When not fighting, the humanoids are responsible for caring and providing for their draconic companions, though this domestic role is more a social dynamic than outright servitude. Built for speed, dragonkin are long and sleek. Many adopt mannerisms from humanoid races, even going so far as to wear armor, and this, combined with the fact that dragonkin have thrown in their lot with humanoids, sometimes disgusts true dragons. A typical dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and roughly 2,000 pounds.",

      "description": "Possessing the savage instincts of lions with the cunning of brass dragons, dragonnes combine the fiercest features of these noble creatures into predators both awe-inspiring and deadly. The origin of dragonnes generates endless speculation. The odds of these creatures being direct crossbreeds of dragons and lions are quite remote, for numerous reasons: the two creatures rarely share the same territories; few creatures as clever as brass dragons would choose to mate with simple lions; and dragonne abilities differ significantly from those of metallic dragons. While otherworldly breeding experiments and magical mishaps remain possibilities, few satisfying explanations make themselves apparent. Although many creatures rightly fear these ferocious hunters, few dragonnes are blatantly evil-most are just highly territorial and seek to defend their homes and hunting grounds from interlopers. Creatures that draw too close to a dragonne's lair are typically met by the resident's fearsome roar, followed by its claws and fangs if this warning is ignored. Those who attempt to settle in a dragonne's territory find themselves harassed constantly until they decide to leave or the dragonne is slain. These intimidating predators spend the majority of their time on the ground, even when in combat, since their wings prove somewhat ungainly. They typically search for prey and intruders from the air, then land nearby to charge and pounce. Despite their deadliness, dragonnes form strong bonds with those they consider members of their pride, sometimes even adopting creatures of other races. A character with the Leadership feat can take a dragonne as a cohort. Such characters must have an effective leadership level of 10th. Most dragonne cohorts gain levels in barbarian, fighter, or ranger. A dragonne measures between 10 and 12 feet long and weighs up to 1,200 pounds.",

The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save to steel itself against this morbid onslaught. If that save fails, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim takes 4d6 points of damage. A creature that successfully saves against the initial Will save is not subject to the same drocha swarm's project death ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br>The opening of the Worldwound brought many horrors to the world, and one of the more tragic and horrible results was the elimination of the Sarkorian people. The mass deaths of these people spawned roiling clouds of unquiet spirits called drocha swarms. Each made of the spirits of hundreds of Sarkorians who died at once, these ghostly swarms reveal the screaming faces of those who once lived and thrived in this verdant land. Their lives were cut short either by the ripping open of the terrain itself or by the demons that subsequently poured forth from the Abyss. Now, these tortured swarms of spirits roam the Worldwound, alone or in packs. Drocha swarms are devoid of the goodliness and respect for nature they had in life. All these tortured souls can do is scream and torment others, and though incorporeal, their razor-sharp teeth materialize just long enough to tear at any creatures they happen across. Mostly translucent, drocha swarms contain only the faintest traces of black and green delineating the writhing mouths and rolling eyes of the faces within. The faces moan independently, creating a cacophony of voices, each shouting rage at its death or screaming for others to listen to the story of its plight. It would be maddening to pick out individual voices and follow their terrible cries. The swarm can expand and contract as necessary, pouring over enemies and draining them of the life drocha swarms were so violently denied, an action that does not seem to bring the pitiful creatures any relief from their hideous afterlife.</br>",

Before the Worldwound opened, they were virtually nonexistent in the Inner Sea region, though some theorize the Sodden Lands could have their own form of drocha swarms made up of those who perished when the Eye of Abendego formed and ravaged the Lirgeni people, practically eliminating them from the Inner Sea. The dead individuals that make up a drocha swarm have lost any identity they once had and are hideously transformed; they are now horrific vehicles of undeath, created only when the conditions are right. As dead souls trapped on the Material Plane are wont to do, drocha swarms are angry and vengeful, and attack any living thing near them with impunity. Since these swarms are composed of undead spirits, once reduced to 0 hit points, drocha swarms are immediately destroyed instead of dispersing. Whether these unquiet spirits are then freed from their connection to the Material Plane and are able to pass on to the Boneyard is unclear. Many scholars believe that destroyed drocha swarms do not pass on to their final judgment and instead are flung to different edges of the Worldwound, where they slowly reform. These scholars state that the real tragedy in regard to putting these horrifying beings out of their tortured misery is that those who defeat them are not liberating the tortured souls, but rather just postponing future encounters with new drocha swarms. This theory is telling, for if drocha swarms were indeed destroyed, there would be fewer and fewer of them every year. However, encounters with these deadly swarms have shown no hint of letting up.",

            "description": "Drocha swarms typically stay in the area in which they died, repeatedly going over the same territory in an ostensible attempt to understand why the villages and cities in which they lived are no longer there. In contrast, some drocha swarms float all about the Worldwound attacking demons and humanoids alike. When drocha swarms attack demons, their screams and wails change tone and pitch, as if the spirits understand demons were responsible for their demise. Because of their roaming nature, these swarms infrequently encounter each other. As unintelligent undead, drocha swarms have no society. Even when swarms come across each other, they seem unaware of each other's existence-which is perhaps unsurprising since drocha swarms focus on living things. On rare occasions, drocha swarms have been reported to collide with each other. When this event occurs, a strange thing happens. The two (or more) swarms appear to merge together, the translucent cloud of screaming faces darkening and billowing out in an even more chaotic roil. The screaming faces that float within the deadly mass pass through one another in a twisted dance and the volume of their wails increases to a painfully uncomfortable level. The merged swarm pulses and continues to grow larger than the volume of the two individual drocha swarms. This horrid mass coalesces and ceases flying, coming to rest on the ground, and remaining stationary for hours at a time. During this period, living creatures can actually approach the merged swarm without the drocha swarms pursuing them, though some have reported that pseudopod-like appendages stretch out from the mass and probe the air in the direction of the living. After several hours, the wails and shrieks build to a crescendo loud enough to make one's ears bleed and the area of the swarm's fear aura doubles. Once this happens, the merged cloud of drocha swarms rapidly pulses, then dramatically contracts to the size of a single drocha swarm. It's unknown whether the two merge and take up the same space or one swarm takes over the other. Some believe the two swarms engage in a brutal battle with one another until a single swarm is destroyed. It's believed this is the only way the component spirits can be freed from their tortured existence, but what truly happens in these rare circumstances is unknown. To the few untainted individuals who still call the Worldwound home, drocha swarms are as infamous as demons for their ability to cause destruction and turmoil wherever they go. Because they are clearly not demons, however, a few stories have emerged in the hundred years that drocha swarms have existed. Some say the Sarkorians, who nervously predicted the thinness of their realm, deserve their fate for not fleeing. Others say there was no way the Sarkorians could have predicted their fates. Still others claim the Sarkorians are the victims of a greater force, which needed thousands of lives to manifest its evil nature on the Material Plane. Who is correct is anyone's guess.",

While their favored victims are evil men and women (or their living descendants) whose souls are destined for Hell, the dullahans have no qualms about adding innocents to their lists of victims.Legends tell of powerful dullahans who can summon not just a single fiendish mount, but an entire carriage pulled by six powerful ebony horses. Known as a \"Coach of the Silent,\" these powerful undead are CR 14 with 20 Hit Dice, the advanced creature simple template, and the ability to cast trap the soul on those who fail to resist their death's calling. These souls take seats in the coach, where they languish forever-or at least until the dullahan himself is slain.",

While its ghostly form is evidence enough of its twisted hatred, a duppy also possesses power over a pack of faithful, otherworldly hounds that share in their master's malignance. Duppies typically seek out sailors and pirates to exact their vengeance on, seeking to inf lict great violence on those living creatures who remind them of what they lost in life. For this reason, duppies are most often found in seaside towns or nearby beaches, and settlements that rely on the ocean know to fear and hate these ghastly beings. The presence of a duppy is often preceded by the distant sound of unearthly howling. While a duppy's incorporeal form ensures that it cannot be captured via mundane means, those who do manage to trick a duppy into a trap are wise to keep the horror confined until day, when its otherworldly abilities are hindered and it can be more easily defeated. However, few creatures can muster powers strong enough to cage a duppy, whose hounds confound enemies and allow the ghostly monster to attack victims from all sides.",

Divination: Gains the effects of detect chaos, evil, good, or law. Enchantment: Grants the effects of the spell heroism.

Beings as much composed of sculpted arcane eddies as of flesh and blood, these capricious felines flourish along the intangible ley lines of their home realm, drinking in its weird powers as a plant thrives on light. Yet even more potent than their thirst for magic and the euphoria they draw from being in proximity to the reshaping of reality is dweomercats' racial curiosity, which leads them endlessly across the First World-and often beyond.

The burst of magical energy brought forth by a freshly cast spell momentarily intensifies the bond between the First World and the dweomercat. This link manifests itself clumsily as a sort of sudden teleportation that heaves the fey cat through space and time toward the source of the spell, fueled by the magnetic reaction between the dweomercat and the magic's origin. A dweomercat grows not by the passage of time, but through direct exposure to fey magic. Thus, a dweomercat cub on the Material Plane is stunted developmentally. Though it ages and gains experience and practical wisdom anywhere, only by spending several lifetimes on the First World can the cub reach adulthood.

Cut off from the direct magical eddies of the First World, dweomercat cubs prove unable to grow into adults. While they might become slightly stronger and more learned, they never reach the size and prowess of those constantly subjected to the magic of their homeland. Were a dweomercat cub to return to the First World, it would eventually grow into a normal dweomercat, but only over the course of numerous humanoid lifespans. Those dweomercats marooned on the Material Plane seek out areas of great age, changeability, and magical potency- lands most like the First World. Sometimes this means not a specific place, but rather a period spent journeying with a mortal spellcaster. While an adult dweomercat would scoff at the idea of following a humanoid's orders, adolescents see the benefit of journeying alongside an intelligent creature native to the alien world. Should a dweomercat cub find a magic-user reckless or whimsical enough to keep its attention, it might join the caster as a familiar, gaining a measure of constant magical exposure from the intangible connection inherent in such a mystical relationship.<br/>",

Wherever the perverse will of foul deities takes root, there ebon acolyti might be found.An ebon acolytus's most feared ability is its power to sacrifice living creatures to the dark entity to whom it is devoted. This foul capability rises from a series of profane rites conducted as part of the construct's creation, during which it is bound to a specific patron. A ebon acolytus cannot be reconsecrated to a different deity, and those it sacrifices always appear in the same extraplanar realm.The being an ebon acolytus is created to serve must be of at least deity-level power, and all attempts to create servants that direct souls to a lesser or more vague source fail.Thus, ebon acolyti are typically found dedicated to evil gods, demon lords, archdevils, one of the four horsemen, or similar beings.Those killed by an ebon acolytus prove exceedingly diffcult to recover, except by the power of those devoted to the deity to whom the victim was sacrificed. As such, foul priests often employ ebon acolyti to gain bargaining chips, having their construct minion sacrifice a being and demanding some service should the victim's loved ones wish him returned. Alternately, worshipers of notorious deities often face worldly retribution, but might escape tenacious pursuers by sacrificing themselves to their deity, their sacrificial deaths allowing them to forever elude the magic and vengeance of their foes. Occasionally, there are those who seek to track down and reclaim souls wrongfully slain by ebon acolyti. Many quests to unholy realms have been undertaken in the attempt to rescue such damned souls, though few meet with any success.Although most discussion of ebon acolyti connects them with foul deities, such need not be the case. Tools first and foremost, these constructs might serve non-evil gods, though in most cases their murderous aptitudes are ill suited to such worship. In some cases, particularly in the instances of exotic and little-known deities who prove both benevolent and bloodthirsty, ebon acolyti might be found in the service of goodly faiths, though such instances are exceedingly rare.Construction An ebon acolytus is chiseled from a single block of dark stone, often black granite or marble, jade, or some other lustrous material, and weighing at least 4,000 pounds.The stone must be of exceptional quality and costs at least 6,000 gp.",

Embalming bears employed as guardians are designed to deliver dangerous doses of embalming fluid with strikes from their powerful claws. Few of these creatures exist, and those that do are found where alchemy is widely practiced or where mummification of pets and guardians is a part of funereal tradition. Embalming bears are often created to guard over precious treasures, but some serve less significant functions, and are merely trophies preserved by taxidermists and animated to decorate macabre halls or guard remote locations. An embalming bear is different from other animated objects in that the process of its creation includes a step that turns the chemicals that preserve the taxidermic animal into a weapon. This especially powerful embalming fluid is a deadly poison when injected into the injuries of living enemies. The main purpose of the liquid, though, is to provide the bear with a semifluid mobility normally not afforded to animated objects. Many embalming bears (such as the one described here) have armor plates bolted onto their bodies, typically disguised as pieces of ceremonial armor to make the creature look as if it had been used in battle. Though this is often just an affectation, some embalming bears actually are honored creatures that died in battle and were then turned into eternal servants.

      "description": "Known by many names-the Fallen, the Ash Wings, and the Furies-the devils called erinyes mock the form of the angelic hosts in their exaction of vengeance and bloody justice. Executioners, not judges, erinyes alight upon the bladed eaves of Dis, Hell's cosmopolitan second layer, ever attentive for chances to soar into battle, whether in defense of Hell, on the whims of diabolical masters, or at the impassioned summons of jilted mortal summoners. All erinyes weave deadly living ropes from their own hair, which they use in battle to lift their foes into the air, mocking and condemning their victims for their transgressions before dropping them from great heights.Erinyes appear as darkly beautiful angels, augmenting their sensuality with deliberate bruises and scars. Yet despite their beauty, erinyes are not seducers-they lack the subtlety and patience required for such fine emotional manipulations, and instead vastly prefer to solve their problems with swift and excruciating violence. Often, an erinyes will stay her hand before attempting to slay a foe simply so she can draw out the victim's suffering. Death is usually the only way to escape an erinyes's not-so-tender attentions, and the most powerful of these devils excel at keeping their enemies alive but helpless so as to extend their torment-many going as far as to keep their victims alive with magic. Rumors hold that the most powerful erinyes torturers have skills that allow their torment to continue even after their subject has died from their attentions.Most erinyes stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh approximately 140 pounds, even with their blackfeathered wings that stretch over 10 feet wide.",

Their fall in battle remains the greatest disappointment in their souls. Most fallen are still adorned in the battered and breached armor they died in and armed with the weapons they once carried into battle. Sentient and suffering, the fallen wander the Worldwound in search someone to end their misery by performing last rites. At a glance, a fallen might be mistaken for a well-armed ghost or spectre, but even casual study reveals that their fiery eyes are not vacant, and they're anything but mindless.

            "description": "Upon death, a soul normally enters the Great Beyond and travels to the Boneyard, and once there, travels to an appropriate Outer Plane to become a petitioner. Whatever fate befalls that petitioner, whether it is destroyed or its energies are released to create an outsider, it never returns to the Boneyard again. Spiritualists speculate that the Abyssal energies pervasive throughout the Worldwound have altered the planar structure of the region in such a way that in very rare cases, typically among the strong-willed, some souls instinctively react as if were on an Outer Plane already and never depart for the Boneyard. These are the fallen. The fallen are spontaneously created, and are similar to ghosts but for one crucial difference-the fallen have no remaining unfinished business to tie them to the Material Plane aside from receiving a proper burial. Like many other types of undead, the fallen have an aversion to sunlight. They are incapable of becoming corporeal, but can open and close doors, hurl objects, and otherwise manifest their displeasure through the use of telekinesis, and their ghostly weapons still strike true and deal damage since they are made of force. A fallen can even shroud itself in darkness so tangible that most demons cannot penetrate it. When funeral rites are conducted upon the place where they died, the infusion of positive energy scours away the Abyssal taint. This localized restoration of the natural cosmological order allows the soul of the fallen to escape to the Great Beyond and thus receive judgment. Though they were crusaders in life, fallen typically avoid the demons of the Worldwound unless they happen upon an injured or distracted one. Their shame at dying by demonic claws and their tortured existence hinders their ability to strike at the demons in their current state. When fallen encounter mortals, they typically plead for release from their condition through burial. They don't give the mortals much time to decide for themselves, instead using their abilities to compel the mortals into service-or slaying them in anger and frustration.",

Some fallen lie to would-be rescuers, promising to reveal great treasure near the place they died. Others attack outright if not helped, take hostages, or threaten reprisals against family members or other innocents. That the Worldwound is too dangerous for most adventurers is inconsequential to them-for when did the fallen ever waver when duty called? Some simply go mad and cannot be reasoned with. The most tragic and desperate of the fallen are those that cannot remember where they died. Their dark nature notwithstanding, the fallen understand enough about the reality of their situation to call upon clerics and paladins to help them. They can manage to hold back their rage in these situations and refrain from attacking the one who can help end their plight, but this doesn't stop them from attacking a cleric's companions.

      "description": "Formian taskmasters are merchants, traders, diplomats, and spies, and particularly talented taskmasters may even advise the queen. Taskmasters can often be found outside the hive engaging in commerce or routine diplomatic missions. While traveling, a taskmaster is usually accompanied by 3-5 workers and at least 5 warriors. When dealing with other creatures, formians recognize that their telepathy can be off-putting and use normal speech, although their mandibles are not well suited for the task and their voices are often hoarse and diff icult to understand. Like myrmarchs, taskmasters are highly competitive and take great pride in their successes. Notable accomplishments are carved into their carapaces and highlighted with the use of bright inks, precious metals, or gems. Formian society is largely free of the crime that is common in other humanoid societies, but formians do have occasional duels within a caste. Two taskmasters might have a duel over promotions, a trade route, or an insult. These duels are rarely lethal for fear of weakening the hive, and taskmasters who are too aggressive attract the wrong kind of attention from the myrmarchs. Dueling victories are often recorded on taskmasters' carapaces alongside their other major accomplishments.",

They are larger than other drakes, reaching heights of up to 16 feet and weighing upward of 2,500 pounds. Their wide, clawed feet enable them to easily burrow through snow, though not through dirt or clay.Young frost drakes form adolescent hunting packs divided along gender lines, but older frost drakes are usually encountered in mated pairs. Frost drakes mate for life, leaving their packs when they find a suitable mate.Mated pairs make a nest together, and the female lays a clutch of two to five eggs. Both parents care for their offspring when they hatch, and families usually form small packs until the young reach maturity at 5 years of age. At this point, the parents abandon their offspring, usually laying a new clutch of eggs in a new nest elsewhere, and leaving the fledgling drakes to find their own adolescent packs to join.",

      "description": "A frost giant's hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes usually match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts, along with any jewelry they own.Frost giant warriors also don chain shirts and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers. An adult male stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old.Frost giants are among the most feared giants, as their wanton destruction, battle lust, and fearless demeanor push them to ever-increasing displays of brutality. Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with their enormous greataxes. A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will have difficulty reaching them, and then starting an avalanche before leaping into battle. Frost giants can hide well in snowy environments and are masters of stealth in their domain.Frost giants survive on hunting and raiding alone, as they live in desolate, frigid environments. Frost giant groups are split almost evenly between those that live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles and those that roam the frozen north as nomads in search of spoils and provisions. Frost giant leaders call themselves jarls and demand absolute obedience from their followers. At any time a jarl may be challenged by combat for leadership of the tribe. These challenges typically result in the death of one of the combatants. A single jarl can often count a dozen or more smaller frost giant tribes as part of his extended tribe. In such a situation, the leaders of the lesser tribes are known simply as chieftains or warlords.Frost giants love to take captives, and use them for food as well as slaves and commodities.Every group of frost giants typically has 1-2 humanoid slaves shackled to a slave handler- usually the meanest and cruelest non-jarl in the group. They are also quite fond of monstrous pets- white dragons and winter wolves are popular choices, but remorhazes, yetis, and even linnorms can be found dwelling in a frost giant lair.",

      "description": "When an especially jealous or greedy evil person dies, it sometimes returns as a gaki-a misshapen creature with a supernatural hunger for things of the material world. Mistakenly called \"hungry ghosts\" because of their ability to fly and turn invisible, gakis believe that if they consume the right material-typically meat, wine, blood, flowers, and souls-they can form a new body resembling their former mortal shapes. Its long, thin neck restricts how much it can eat, and the creature is perpetually starving. It prefers to consume evil creatures, believing it gains more sustenance from a sinful being than a righteous one, but it won't pass up any mortal flesh. Some gakis believe they must consume flesh from demons or undead, and fixate on these creatures to the aversion of all others. Gakis are cursed, pitiable creatures with nothing to lose, which makes them very dangerous. Some that have existed for many years as undead grow desperate and try consuming earth, sewage, or more vile substances in an attempt to find the missing ingredient for their transformation. Particularly unfortunate ones bear an onerous curse that causes anything they try to eat to burst into flame or wither away into dust. These creatures have short memories and little sense of perspective. They're smart enough to pursue what they want cannily, but fail at making long-term plans. Most gakis wander alone, pursuing their search for nourishment in solitude. When they do form packs, they use their numbers to surround and bring down large animals or groups of people, but then throw cooperation aside to squabble and shove as each one greedily tries to claim the entire prize they've taken. Strangely, gakis are scorched by moonlight and frozen by sunlight. Because of this, they're forced to lurk in the shadows of ruins. Some wander the deep caves and tunnels below the surface, scrounging whatever meals they can find. In urban areas, they group together to stalk the slums, often leaping upon victims, tearing away small morsels of flesh before they retreat, leaving victims bleeding and disoriented. They find hiding places- often in abandoned buildings or sewers- to stay during the day, turning invisible and biding their time till the dark of night comes.",

When a geist enters a haunt's area of effect, the geist can immediately attempt to take over the haunt by making a Charisma check. If the result of the Charisma check is equal to or greater than the haunt's CR, the geist takes over the haunt and maintains control as long as the geist remains within 1 mile. If the geist's attempt to take control of a haunt fails, the geist must retreat from the haunt's area of effect and cannot attempt to take control of the haunt again for 24 hours. When a geist controls a haunt, it can activate or suppress the haunt's effects as a free action and the haunt automatically resets in half its normal time. A haunt under a geist's control can still be neutralized when reduced to 0 hit points, but it cannot be permanently put to rest until the geist that controls it is destroyed.

      "description": "No simple garden pests, giant slugs pose a serious threat to those caught in their path. Folk who dwell near swamps and other regions that support giant slugs risk losing livestock and even their homes to these enormous beasts. Giant slugs constantly wander in search of food, their preference being fleshy organic material, which they slice into smaller, easily gulped chunks with their rasp-like tongues.What strange inf luence might have caused the first giant slugs to grow to such monstrous proportions is unknown, but today, giant slugs breed true and birth their oversized offspring after a fleshy, squirming courtship ritual. After mating, a female giant slug lays just over a hundred eggs, each approximately a foot in diameter. The mother slug guards this clutch fiercely and aggressively attacks any creatures that wander too close. Giant slugs inhabiting swamps aboveground mate once a year, and those who live in the area know better than to go into the swamps during this month.Deep below ground, some subterranean races use giant slugs as mounts or guardians. Creatures like mites, who have a strange empathy with vermin, can be used to keep giant slugs docile, but in most cases, those who would use giant slugs must do so with great care, keeping them well fed until they are needed for battle. Frightened whispers report armies of troglodytes using giant slugs as siege mounts. One particularly disturbing tale mentions a vast underground cavern inhabited by scores of skum and aboleth-controlled aquatic giant slugs with strange, mind-numbing abilities infused into their acidic saliva.",

In addition to being able to slash creatures with its wings as a melee attack, it may beat its wings, flinging two large, feathered shards at a single target. These wing razors deal 2d6 points of damage and cause bleed. A giant stymphalides can use this attack a number of time per day equal to its Constitution modifier.<br/>Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalides stalk the arid plains and coastlines of Golarion in ravenous swarms, shredding warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their bladed feathers and dagger-like beaks. From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other longnecked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake.Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon.The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help.Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms.",

When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean.</br>Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock.Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms.",

The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures' prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles.</br>When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land.Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.",

      "description": "Gorgons are magical, foul-tempered creatures-while they might appear to be constructs at first glance, beneath their artificallooking armor plates they are made of flesh and bone. Like aggressive bulls, they challenge any unfamiliar creature they encounter, often trampling their opponent's corpse or shattering its stony remnants until the creature is unrecognizable. The females are just as dangerous as the males, and the two sexes appear identical. A typical gorgon stands 6 feet tall and 8 feet long. It weighs 4,000 pounds.Gorgons derive nutrients from the consumption of minerals, particularly the stone of their petrified victims, and any statues they create are likely to be gnawed thoroughly. They cannot digest metal or gems, so their dung (which resembles bitter-smelling gray powder) often contains small, raw crystals and nuggets of ore. Their aggression toward all other creatures means that there are few to no predators or other prey animals in their grazing grounds. Each herd is led by a dominant bull; solitary gorgons are usually adolescent bulls driven out of their herd by the lead bull.Their flesh is tough but beefy (once the armored hide is removed), and to those who acquire the taste, quite filling. Many stone giant tribes believe eating gorgon meat enhances their own natural armor. Powdered gorgon horn is worth 250 gp as an alternate material component for magic items using bull's strength, stoneskin, flesh to stone, statue, and similar magic.",

      "description": "Standing over 9 feet tall and weighing in excess of 4,000 pounds, a gray render is a solitary and savage predator. Renders are gifted with immense strength, and some reports claim to have witnessed a gray render uprooting a fully grown tree and tearing it to splinters in order to catch prey hiding within.Gray renders actively avoid forming groups or communities with their own kind, and perhaps only tolerate the presence of other renders when it is time to mate. Some sages claim they are asexual, but it is more likely they are hermaphrodites able to self-fertilize, and reproduce only rarely.Despite its solitary existence, a gray render often develops an affectionate bond with other creatures, typically a herd of herbivores or a small tribe of humanoids, but in some cases a solitary denizen of its swamp. The render acts as a guardian for this creature or creatures, never straying more than a mile away, running to protect them if they are attacked, and providing an offering of meat once each day, as might a domesticated cat. A gray render never harms its protected creatures, and retreats in confusion if they attack it. Most animal \"pets\" grow to accept its presence, and primitive humanoid \"pets\" often believe their guardian is a sign of favor from the gods. A render's bond may last from a few months to as long as 10 years, after which it wanders to a new territory and ignores its former favorites.Renders are generally not malicious, and only attack if hungry or if they or their pets are threatened. A render protecting its pets fights to the death.",

One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings.An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground. An air elemental can move underwater, and although it is an elemental and thus runs no risk of drowning, it has no ranks in Swim and loses much of its speed and mobility when underwater. <table> <tr><th>Elemental</th><th>Height</th><th>Weight</th><th>Whirlwind Save DC</th><th>Whirlwind Height</th></tr> <tr><td>Small</td><td>4 ft.</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>12</td><td>10-20 ft.</td></tr> <tr><td>Medium</td><td>8 ft.</td><td>2 lbs.</td><td>14</td><td>10-30 ft.</td></tr> <tr><td>Large</td><td>16 ft.</td><td>4 lbs.</td><td>18</td><td>10-40 ft.</td></tr> <tr><td>Huge</td><td>32 ft</td>. <td>8 lbs.</td><td>22</td><td>10-50 ft.</td></tr> <tr><td>Greater</td><td>36 ft.</td><td>10 lbs.</td><td>23</td><td>10-60 ft.</td></tr> <tr><td>Elder</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>12 lbs.</td><td>27</td><td>10-60 ft.</td></tr> </table>",

To combat this possibility, many mobs or rural justices take to the practice of burning the bodies, grinding the bones, and scattering the remains in the wild. Yet in the case of particularly evil criminals, even these steps are in vain, for their will is enough to reassemble a body from earth, stone, roots, and plants drawn from the region into which the remains were scattered. Such an undead horror rises as a guecubu, a harbinger of misfortune and vengeance from beyond the grave. A newly formed guecubu remembers well how its enemies treated it, and while the undead creature retains none of its previous life's talents, its undead state grants it many new tools to seek revenge with. Typically, a guecubu does not limit its revenge to those directly involved with its execution-entire villages and towns fall victim to its rage. The guecubu's tactics tend toward the subtle, and it seeks to spread misfortune and death on a person-by-person basis, slaying its enemies one at a time until they flee, so that all that remains is a ghost town. A guecubu is 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.",

      "description": "Although there are many different species of sphinx, the one certain scholars refer to as the \"gynosphinx\" (a name many sphinxes find insulting) is a wise and majestic creature that is nevertheless terrifying when angered. Less moralistic than their male counterparts (the \"androsphinx\"-a different creature entirely than the sphinx presented here), sphinxes are careful and methodical in their decision-making, and pride themselves on their cold logic and impartiality.They have little patience for the lesser sphinx variants, seeing them as little better than animals. Sphinxes love riddles and complicated dilemmas, and treasure strange facts and arcane trivia far more than gold or gems While not great scholars in any traditional sense, sphinxes' great appreciation of puzzles leads them to research shallowly in a wide variety of subjects, and they can often be invaluable sources of information, especially when making use of their magical abilities. They are usually happy to barter with other races, and regularly trade material goods for information or new and interesting quandaries. They make excellent guardians for temples, tombs, and other important locations, so long as they are kept adequately entertained. Sphinxes place great value on politeness, but can be dangerously temperamental-while they may decide to share their latest riddles with travelers out of altruism, they think little of devouring those who don't give their dilemmas adequate attention or provide useful insight.Sphinxes are typically 10 feet long and about 800 pounds. While their wings are capable of holding them aloft for long periods of time, they are poor fliers, and prefer to land before engaging foes, lashing out with their powerful claws. Though fiercely territorial, they tend to give intruders plenty of warning before attacking.",

The alchemical torture they undergo seems minor compared to what other fleshwarps suffer-it merely increases the mass and strength of the vegepygmy and deforms its eyes so they secrete acid. The process has a more interesting effect on the residual and previously inert russet mold within the body of the host vegepygmy. Mutating the mold, it creates a deadly spore that courses through the halsora's insides, is slowly excreted through the fingertips, and clumps on the claws of the creature. Though their sunken eyes and constant stream of acidic tears often make these creatures seem pitiful, they are fierce bundles of rage and self-hatred. The conditioning of the fleshwarpers causes them to attack and infect any enemy of the drow they come in contact with, but what's left of their consciousness rages against the mutated spores they carry. Worse still, many drow use these creatures to hunt down and even infect other tribes of vegepygmies.",

These carnivorous plants are incredibly patient, and can wait for months in a single location for food to approach. When prey does draw near, the tree's vines lash like striking snakes. The tree often uses its pull ability to hoist grappled foes 10 to 15 feet in the air so that they are out of reach of allies while they slowly strangle. The tree generally only swallows one foe whole at a time, letting its other captured victims dangle and ripen until it is ready to feed on them. A hangman tree is 30 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds.",

      "description": "The hellcat is a devious predator native to the fiery pits of Hell. While the hellcat is not a devil itself, it often acts as a guardian or mount for devils.Some might assume that hellcats serve devils as pets, but since hellcats are as intelligent as humans, they take offense to the idea that they might be anyone's pet.On its own, a hellcat prefers to spend its time hunting and stalking prey. While the hellcat, as an outsider, need not eat to survive, it does enjoy eating for pleasure, often leaving significant portions of its kills behind for others to find. A hellcat that enters into an alliance with a devil is often used as a sort of hunter as a result. Human mortals can use spells like planar ally or planar binding to conjure hellcats for similar purposes. Those who do so are well advised to treat the hellcat with respect, for should any master prove too haughty with his hellcat or treat it as a dumb animal, the hellcat nurtures a lasting grudge. In such instances, the hellcat goes to great lengths to plan and coordinate revenge on the spellcaster, hoping to satisfy its own pride and to provide a lesson and example to all those who would deal with their kind.Though incapable of speech themselves, hellcats understand the Infernal tongue of their home plane, and can communicate by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly overmatched or up against foes they cannot reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them, and will often track potential victims and try to lead allies (including other hellcats) to them in order to make coordinated attacks or ambushes.The hellcat is only clearly visible in dim light, at these times appearing as a skeletal dire tiger with hellish flames burning and flickering along the surface of its bones.Despite this eerie appearance, the hellcat is neither undead nor an elemental creature. The \"fires\" are actually its blood coursing through transparent flesh. In bright light, the hellcat's entire body fades away into obscurity, while in darkness its glowing blood is muted.Hellcats are as large as tigers, measuring 9 feet long and weighing 900 pounds.",

Hill giants wear layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left on. They seldom wash or repair their garments, preferring simply to add more hides as their old ones wear out. Adults are around 10 feet tall and weigh about 1,100 pounds. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old, but almost never do.Hill giants prefer to fight from high, rocky outcroppings, where they can pelt opponents with rocks and boulders while limiting the risk to themselves. Hill giants love to make overrun attacks against smaller creatures when they first join battle. Thereafter, they stand fast and swing away with their massive clubs.Hill giants are the most nomadic of all the humanoid giant species, preferring to travel from one settlement to the next in order to raid and pillage. While they prefer temperate climates, they'll travel far from their preferred environment so long as the raiding is plentiful and successful. They are, as a whole, incredibly selfish creatures and rarely engage in battles they don't automatically know they'll win. Hill giants are known for shoving one another at terrifying foes and won't hesitate to sacrifice a clanmate to save their own skins. Roving bands of hill giants are common in temperate hills, and their constant aggression makes them one of the more feared dangers in this climate.Solitary, non-evil hill giants are very rare but can sometimes be found in other humanoid societies, though they are almost never accepted in central cities or population centers. They do best as laborers and soldiers in outlying frontier towns, and often serve as rudimentary diplomats to negotiate with marauding hill giant bands. Unfortunately, hill giants who shed their racial lifestyle for civilization are mocked and often killed on sight by their nomadic brethren. Still, these \"civilized\" hill giants can find their place within society and many have managed to live peaceful, uneventful lives.",

One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings.An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground.

Whether lightning elementals are the byproduct of common air elementals spending too much time near these electrically charged storms or are merely calved off like forgotten flurries, they are aggressive and almost suicidal in their willingness to leap into battle.They particularly enjoy attacking creatures that are made of metal and creatures that wear metal armor or wield metal weapons.Many lightning elementals have a roughly humanoid shape, but some prefer animalistic shapes (particularly birds and dragons), and a few appear to be nothing more than large disembodied heads made of dark clouds with flickering lightning tongues. Regardless of the shape a lightning elemental takes, the air around the creature hums and throbs with the promise of electrocution and the tangy stink of ozone.",

In their home environment, hydrodaemons swim the sickening rivers and seas of Abaddon and the River Styx, ducking beneath the rivers of pus and bile only to leap out at enemies and rend their flesh with tooth and claw. It is said these are among the few creatures able to survive in the deadly waters of the River Styx. When called to the Material Plane, hydrodaemons serve powerful spellcasters, protecting domains dotted with pools, streams, and even sewer complexes. Associated with death by drowning, these fiends use a favored tactic to draw the most anguish from their victims. Hydrodaemons first attack with their inky black sleep spittle, hoping to render victims unconscious. With their opponents unable to fight back, hydrodaemons drag their enemies into the foul waters they call home and delight as the liquid fills their victims' gasping lungs. If unable to drown a victim, they finish the job with jaws and claws. Hydrodaemons possess an awkward gait, springing back on their heels and leaping about like humanoid frogs. Even so, they move in an unpredictable manner, twisting their bodies with each hopping movement. Hydrodaemons can also unfurl flaps of skin that allow them to glide through the air. Hydrodaemons stand 10 feet tall and weigh upward of 3,000 pounds.",

They are creatures of icy resolution, merciless and unf linching as the arctic winds, bringing doom to both vicious and innocent interlopers equally. Aloof and mysterious, they prefer not to be seen in their natural form, instead cloaking themselves in the fur and shape of swift elk or caribou. Yet even then they're usually only glimpsed as fleeting shadows. Those who lock gazes with ijiraqs see the world around them begin to swim, seeming unreal to the extent that even a skilled forester might be unable to determine which way is north, and a life-long native of a place might become lost within sight of home. Few can honestly claim to have ever seen an ijiraq's true face, as the creatures wear skulls taken from impressive specimens of their alternate forms as masks. Ijiraqs typically stand about 5 feet tall-though that height reaches over 6 feet including their impressive horns- and weigh approximately 175 pounds.",

      "description": "Very little is known about these enigmatic and mysterious creatures, as their very nature makes details of their true form difficult to discern. Brought to this world from the Plane of Air, these creatures fulfill tasks for those who conjure them. Invisible stalkers act as guardians, assassins, and trackers, occupations in which they excel. Their natural invisibility and skill at stealth allow them to follow their quarry without detection and give them the upper hand when it comes to exterminating a mark. Many invisible stalkers resent this and see these petty tasks as nothing more than chores dictated by mortals. When given a particularly complex or bothersome task, an invisible stalker seeks to find a loophole in a poorly worded instruction. For instance, wizards calling an invisible stalker into service with the instructions \"protect me from danger\" might find themselves escorted to a faraway hidden location, or even brought to the Plane of Air. Due to their constant summoning, many invisible stalkers harbor hostility for those dwelling on the Material Plane. Those invisible stalkers new to the mortal world only know the stories of their kind and tend to keep an open mind about the intentions of those who call them. Over time, or in the service of a particularly vile master, invisible stalkers form negative opinions of these creatures of flesh and bone, leading to their tendency to pervert their instructions and cause harm to their masters. For older and more experienced invisible stalkers, the only thing protecting those who summon them is the magic that binds them. These creatures automatically try to use inconsistencies in the wording of their tasks and literal twists on the intention to find a way to inconvenience, injure, or even kill the priest or arcanist that brought them to the plane.",

Each irnakurse suffers long under the knife of the dark elves' most practiced fleshwarpers until its body and mind lie in total ruin. When the weeks of torture and transformation are complete, what was once an elf emerges as a shrieking mockery of its lost grace, a horror of reworked flesh and broken bones, a \"perfect\" elf to the drow and a sin against life to elvenkind. Through the blasphemous tortures that create them, irnakurse are made completely mad and become unable to harm drow. All non-drow, however, they view as targets to vent their terror and rage upon. Elves especially provoke irnakurses' ire.

Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear. Black dragons tend to make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in caves at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile up their filthy treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck. Black dragons prefer their food a bit rotten and will often allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before consuming it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay, making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects made from stone or metal.",

Though some believe the jyoti are inherently good because their home plane is the source of all life, these beliefs are quite in error, for the jyoti react to all other races with wary suspicion at best, and usually assume the worst and attack before they can themselves be attacked. They guard their crystalline cities from all intrusion, especially by creatures from other planes and servants of the gods. They have been known to hold dangerous artifacts in their vaults on behalf of desperate visitors, though in the case of holy or unholy artifacts, the jyoti are more likely to destroy the artifacts as soon as possible. Jyoti loathe natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane in particular, though there is an element of pity in their actions toward undead. They never discuss the sceaduinar, and even hearing that name inf lames jyoti into immediate anger. Those who dare argue on the sceaduinar's behalf are immediately attacked.",

They have a stag's graceful body and cloven hooves, a pair of backward-facing horns, and a thick mane and tail ranging from golden to brilliant reds or purples in the hues of the setting sun. Their hide resembles that of a dragon, the scales gleaming ebon or iridescent green. Rare in the extreme, kirin seldom meddle openly in worldly affairs, preferring a subtle hand in overturning the schemes of wicked spirits such as hags and oni. The blood of young kirin runs hot, however, and such spirited youths may serve as mounts for cavaliers and paladins of clever wit and untarnished moral quality. The wisest and most powerful kirin are known as emperor kirin, having earned this title through the respect of their peers and the strength of their powers. They resemble standard kirin, except their hooves give off sparks as they gallop through the air. Emperor kirin have the advanced creature simple template and additional racial Hit Dice. When advancing a kirin's Hit Dice to create an emperor kirin, make the following additional changes. <ul><li> CR: Increase by 1 + the number of additional HD. <li> Breath Weapon: Damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 additional HD. <li> Spellcasting: Increase sorcerer level (for the purpose of spells known and spells per day) by 1 per additional HD. <li> Spell-Like Abilities: Increase caster level by +1 per additional HD. <li> Spell Resistance: Increase by +1 per additional HD.</li></li></li></li></li></ul>",

      "description": "These foul creatures are a disgusting cross between humanoids and condors. Also known as the Eaters of the Dead, the kuchrimas are the lowest order of the lamia-kin, lacking even standard lamias' capability for spell-like abilities. They not only serve the function of common soldiers and scouts, but are also left to take care of the disposal of bodies, garbage, and other waste-most of which they feed upon. This habit results in their foul appearance and disease-ridden bite. Kuchrimas often wield giant bows in their powerful talons, holding the weapon in one talon and pulling the bowstring with the other in order to fire arrows with devastating effect. Kuchrimas have much in common with the condors they resemble, and are opportunistic hunters and scavengers. Bands of kuchrima hunters might fly dozens of miles from their communal aerie, using their keen sight to locate prey both small and large. In the extreme mountainous areas they inhabit, such meals often take the form of giant rams, mountain aurochs, and even the occasional mountaineer, though these disgusting creatures prefer their meals dead and rotting. Kuchrimas dwell principally in the thin air among the upper peaks of desolate mountain ranges, where they have gathered in enclaves or \"gluttonies.\" They have lived in a state of static barbarism since the diaspora following the fall of the Thassilonian Empire. In the thousands of years since that civilization's collapse, these lamia-kin have migrated to many mountainous regions throughout Golarion. These disease-ridden hunters strive to remain well out of sight of land-bound races, which they mistrust and fear in numbers. Should a new runelord or powerful harridan come into power and manage to locate these disparate gluttonies, however, the kuchrimas could be gathered into a formidable airborne force once again.",

These noble creatures dwell in crumbling desert ruins or other remote areas, where they tirelessly fight against the forces of darkness, hoping to defend those they consider lesser races from the evils that often lurk in such places. Although most of these winged sentinels prove wise and knowledgeable about those who would seek to do evil in their lands, many races find lammasus arrogant, dismissive, and patronizing, taking umbrage at their superior attitudes and affectations. Such reactions confuse and sometimes insult these highly honorable creatures, who seek only to do good and aid those weaker than themselves. Lammasus who witness members of other races actively combating evil typically prove more sensitive and address such allies as equals. Should good-aligned creatures prove their skill and overcome any differences of attitude they might have with one of these majestic beings, they find a true and noble ally and an invaluable resource for those hoping to defeat evil. Lammasus are quite parental toward those who join their cause, bringing a lifetime of experience to any struggle. This often makes them stern, but those who know lammasus find them to be extremely caring about those they protect. A lammasu eagerly lays down its own life to protect those in peril if such a sacrifice might win the day. Most lammasus are 8 feet in length and weigh approximately 900 pounds.",

Their eyes burn bright with the flames of their faith, flaring brightest when they conjure forth their weapons. Regardless of the armor they choose to wear, their metallic wings merge with and extend beyond the armor, allowing them flight even when wearing the heaviest of protection.

A lillend's lower section is about 20 feet long, and a typical lillend weighs 3,800 pounds. Although they have no need of mortal nourishment, it is said that lillends sup on the joy of music, art, and performance. They also love unspoiled wilderness and seek out places in the mortal realm that remind them of the beauty of their home plane. From the lore of numerous races come tales of these muses, particularly those that have taken a vested interest in the training of a single talented prodigy or the ongoing creation of some fantastic work of art. Such legends sometimes prove true, as all lillends have their favorite works, creations, and artists, and often visit the Material Plane to enjoy their splendor and make sure they remain safe. In the defense of such beauty, lillends prove passionate foes, calling upon the might of nearby allies or crushing philistines in their striking but deadly coils.",

Males are less able to subsist on minerals, however, and hence hunt more actively. While lurkers above are poor fliers, they're excellent gliders, able drop off a ceiling and silently float more than 100 feet horizontally over the course of a 5- or 6-foot drop.

Though they can otherwise pass for humans, maenads appear bestial when raging or engaging in a bloody revel. They consume massive amounts of wine and food, cause fights, and tear their foes limb from limb. They control people's minds, subconsciously inviting them to engage in their bloody festivities and fostering urges that lead to excesses of hunger, lust, anger, and violence. Maenads can live for thousands of years. They insinuate themselves into normal society before attempting to influence the community.

This allows the undead creatures to select their prey from within the community. Manananggals particularly enjoy feeding upon pregnant women, targeting them in their sleep so the undead may feast on the blood of both mothers and the children they carry. These foul creatures drain blood via their long, black, hollow tongues. Manananggals despise the scent of garlic and strong spices like cloves and anise. As they fly through the night, manananggals make a ticking or clicking sound, leading some villagers to call the creatures \"tik-tiks.\" Once separated, a manananggal's mobile torso has a 6-foot wingspan.",

      "description": "Marai are deviant spellcasters first and fiendish corruptors second. If allowed to indulge in their desire for perverse mystical study, most marai are content to serve as part of another rakshasa's cabal. A solitary marai might pose as a neophyte magician to infiltrate another spellcaster's abode. If the marai is successful, the master soon becomes either the servant or a corpse. The possibility of new magical discoveries drives a marai. Morality and compassion never constrain the fiend's experiments. A marai prefers to torment and exploit mortals who have no idea of the rakshasa's true nature, and it takes great pleasure in using magical might to bring would-be heroes, especially those who invade its lair, to their knees. Such a game offers a marai enjoyment, however, only if subjects are unaware of the danger or at least unable to oppose it. A marai is 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds. Its serpentine arms render fine manipulation or wielding weapons unfeasible, and so it typically assumes humanoid form when working on experiments that require manual dexterity. A marai unable to do so must rely upon cantrips like mage hand for such tasks-or perhaps the aid of a slave or charmed ally.",

The marids are perhaps the most unpredictable and capricious of the genies, a quality that the others (particularly shaitans) find to be both aggravating and embarrassing to the entire genie culture. Many marids become dancers, storytellers, performers, or other types of artists, and often travel to the Material Plane in disguise to seek out new audiences. A small percentage of marids can lay claim to nobility. Noble marids, often called shahzadas, have 14 Hit Dice and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-cone of cold, ice storm; 1/day-elemental swarm (water elementals only), permanent image. A noble marid's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 20th. Noble marids are CR 11.",

      "description": "Medusas are human-like creatures with snakes instead of hair. At distances of 30 feet or more, a medusa can easily pass for a beautiful woman if she wears something to cover her serpentine locks-when wearing clothing that conceals her head and face, she can be mistaken for a human at even closer distances. Medusas use lies and disguises that conceal their faces to get close enough to opponents to use their petrifying gaze, though they like playing with their prey and may fire arrows from a distance to lead enemies into traps. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations out of their victims, using their petrified remains as accents to their swampy lairs, but most medusas take care to hide the evidence of their previous conf licts so that new foes won't have advance warning of their presence.Used to concealing themselves, medusas in cities are usually rogues, while those in the wilderness often pass themselves off as rangers or trackers. The most notorious and legendary medusas, though, are those who take levels as bards or clerics. Charismatic and intelligent, urban medusas are often involved with thieves' guilds or other aspects of the criminal underworld. Medusas may form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both of which are immune to their stony gaze. Spellcasting medusas often serve as oracles or prophets, usually dwelling in remote locations of legendary power or infamous history. Such oracle medusas take great delight in their roles, and if presented with the proper gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer can be quite helpful. Of course, the lairs of such potent creatures are liberally decorated with statues of those who have offended them, so the seeker of knowledge is well advised to tred carefully during such meetings.All known medusas are female. Rarely, a medusa may decide to keep a male humanoid as a mate, usually with the help of elixirs of love or similar magic, and is always careful to not petrify her prisoner-at least until she grows tired of his company.",

      "description": "The deadly mihstus hail from the Plane of Air. When they come to the Material Plane, they prefer to inhabit dank dungeon corridors, abandoned ruins, and the forgotten corridors of lost civilizations. Scholars dispute what drives the ambitions of these creatures, or even what they seek on the Material Plane, but all agree that they are deadly combatants and merciless hunters. Their semi-solid bodies appear to be composed of a strange, white smoke, and they can shape their vaporous bodies at will to seep through small cracks and openings in pursuit of prey. When attacking, they coalesce the tips of their misty tentacles into wickedly barbed talons, slashing at opponents with these razor-sharp appendages.Mihstus rely on their insubstantial nature to close with opponents quickly, engulfing the nearest threat while continuing to attack any who seek to deprive them of their chosen victim. When a mihstu manages to embrace a foe with its body, it drains away the creature's vital fluids at an alarming rate. These fluids churn in the creature's body for a few rounds before spattering against nearby walls or on the floor-the mihstu seems to gain no nourishment from these fluids, so this attack may be nothing more than a favorite method of cruelty.Mihstus are immortal unless slain by violence, and if properly bargained with, these deadly outsiders can actually be intriguing sources of information. Mihstus are normally interested in little more than stalking and consuming prey, and as a result only tend to provide reliable information or cooperate when supplied with intriguing victims to pursue and destroy. Nefarious creatures such as rakshasas and evil cloud giants often utilize mihstus as trackers and assassins, or sometimes employ them as guards in the forgotten corridors of their lairs.",

      "description": "Those who slay many over the course of their lifetimes, be they serial killers, mass-murderers, warmongering soldiers, or battle-driven berserkers, become marked and tainted by the sheer weight of their murderous deeds. When such killers are brought to justice and publicly executed for their heinous crimes before they have a chance to atone, the remains sometimes return to unlife to continue their dark work as a mohrg. Undead things caring less for life than they did before their own deaths, mohrgs exist solely to wreak havoc on the living. Sometimes mistaken for skeletons or zombies, they are far more dangerous than those mindless abominations, retaining some semblance of their own memories-and the delight they once took in hearing the screams of the dying. When possible, mohrgs gather in small groups, seeking out lone targets much as they did in life. If faced with capable foes, a mohrg attempts to incapacitate them one by one, starting with divinely empowered characters first, both to protect itself from holy wrath, and to make the task of paralyzing and devouring the others that much easier. Some mohrgs retain enough of their former memories that they return to the favored locations of their pasts, \"haunting\" old hideouts and sometimes even resuming the depredations of murderers long dead, falling back on means of death and mayhem that were more comfortable in their breathing days. Such mohrgs are even more insane than most undead beings, and can sometimes be found wandering the streets of a city or town in cowls and cloaks, carrying on their old life's work of slaughter and murder as best they can. Of course, since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as undead themselves, the murders of a mohrg do not go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only upon society's dregs. A sudden uprising of undead in the streets is the inevitable result of a mohrg's attentions. Since these zombies remain under the mohrg's control, and since the mohrg itself possesses a hateful and cruel intelligence, it often holds its undead army in reserve, even commanding it to lie motionless until several weeks or months have passed and the local graveyard is filled with the sleeping dead. Then, when the time is right, the mohrg calls upon its army to rise and aid it in finishing the slaughter.",

Inhabitants of the deep tropics, mokele-mbembe dwell in lakes, rivers, swamps and other aquatic regions where they feed on fish, birds, small mammals, and even reptiles. When food runs short and mokele-mbembe grow hungry, they have been known to seek prey from local tribes and villages. Despite being an aggressive hunter, a mokele-mbembe shares some traits with nonpredatory sauropods. Its body is massive and elephantine, with four long legs that end in webbed feet. Its neck is long and flexible like that of herbivorous dinosaurs or giraffes, but its head is triangular, with strong jaws and sharp teeth like a carnivore. A mokele-mbembe's hide is mottled greenish-brown and has the texture of tree bark. Large, defensive spines grow from its back. The mokele-mbembe's natural habitat normally lies far from populous regions. For this reason, they are rarely glimpsed by outsiders, though they are well known to locals who hunt in such lands. Many stories are told about the creatures' size, strength, and ferocity, and some groups even believe them to have a special sacred status as messengers of the gods-or agents of their wrath.",

The tendrils of the plant are independently prehensile and writhe around the large flytrap-like \"head\" that crowns the stem.Moonf lowers have never been known to communicate with other creatures, even with druids and others who regularly converse with plants.The plants do possess some manner of strange telepathy, though, and are in constant communication with their nearby brethren.Those who manage to intrude upon the creatures' alien thoughts face an assault of horrible visions of terrifying jungles filled with ancient, sentient, and malign plants.",

Only mated pairs caring for a litter tolerate each other, and even they separate once the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves. Nependises favors intelligent prey, fey in particular, both for the taste and the thrill of the hunt. They ambush opponents by jumping down from trees, grabbing the creatures, then retreating to find a safe place to eat. When challenged in its territory, a nependis drops from the trees, roars, then fights on foot. A nependis's sharp hooves allow it to climb trees as well as a great cat, leaving telltale scars in the bark. While nependises appear as hybrids of apes and boars, they aren't related to either. Some ascribe the origins of these creatures to a clan of ogres cursed into monstrous forms, or guardians bred and raised by the fey who later turned upon their former masters. A full-grown nependis stands 9 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. A newborn nependis takes 4 years to reach maturity. Nependises rarely die from natural causes, and they live as long as 80 years.",

Its divine heritage grants it a lifespan of almost 600 years. Nephilim are a nomadic, secretive race. This isolationism has only heightened the wild tales surrounding them, making it even harder for other races to trust them. While the ancient animosity humans once had against them has been largely forgotten, zealots occasionally try to mount pogroms and crusades to wipe the nephilim out forever. The nephilim have proven strikingly resistant to these efforts.",

      "description": "In the tropical rainforests of the Kaava Lands and the Mwangi Jungle lurk animalistic offshoots of the cyclopes that once dominated the region. Known as ngogas, these half-orangutan, half-cyclops hybrids are infamous in the folktales of the Mwangi peoples, who fear them for their unpredictability and unnatural agility. In cyclops legends, the ngogas were a gift to the Ghol-Gani from their otherworldly patrons near the collapse of the empire, magical beings infused with the brutality and insight afforded cyclopes, but lacking the intelligence that would make them viable competitors. Ghol-Gani soldiers often trained these beasts to follow them into battle and fight alongside them, and present-day cyclopes who encounter ngogas inevitably feel a sort of kinship to the similarly monocular beasts, enticing them with gifts of fruit and meat in order to gain an ally in their destructive conquests. Since the fall of Ghol-Gan, ngogas have proliferated throughout the dense jungles of central Garund, and many of their kind can be found as deep as Usaro, where the destructive Gorilla King trains them as war-mounts for his smaller minions and relies on their bestial speed to stage ambushes against any who would dare t o intrude upon his realm.",

They take particular joy in corrupting kitsune to form nogitsune, delighting in turning the mystical creatures into deadly killers and spreaders of woe. Most nogitsune become spies or assassins. Though they need no real reason to kill others, the coin they receive for their services allows them to afford the other vices they enjoy, such as pleasures of the flesh and excesses of drink and narcotics (when available). Nogitsune are deft killers because of their speed, grace, and spell-like abilities. Those who have seen them and lived tell tales of these oni running toward walls at blinding speed and then simply continuing upward to vault the wall's crown as if it were no more difficult to walk on than the ground. Still others claim that nogitsune can dive into a shadow like a pool of water and disappear, while others mention the cloud of smoke that nogitsune often use to escape pursuit, even when running full speed. Although they often don human form to disguise themselves for the purpose of inf iltration, nogitsune prefer to stalk and kill prey in their natural form. This gives the creatures the choice of whether to use manufactured weapons or their own sharp claws and deadly bite. When wielding weapons, all nogitsune enjoy using poison, whenever possible employing toxins and venoms that do not kill outright (unless a contract so requires it) but rather render the victims unconscious or helpless. This gives the oni the joy of dealing the killing blow with their jaws and slaking their bloodlust in abject savagery. A nogitsune's most feared weapon, however, is its contagious whisper. This powerful compulsion, often whispered into the victim's ear in honeyed tones, not only forces the targeted creature to believe whatever lie the nogitsune crafts, but also infects the subject of the contagious whisper with a corruptive echo of deceit that causes the victim to unknowingly pass on the nogitsune's suggestion to others. Nogitsune may use this ability to convince a successive series of servants to open all of the doors to a well-guarded castle, or to make a host of witnesses believe they saw an innocent man commit a brutal crime that was really the oni's own handiwork.",

The corruption spread by nuckelavees only serves to further their own sense of self-loathing and overall rage. While nuckelavees might, incidentally, carry out vengeance for the victims of such pollution, defending the denizens of their rivers, swamps, and bogs is not their primary drive, for they revel in inf licting the very corruption they hate and enjoy little more than watching their enemies sicken and die. Folktales tell of talismans to carry-fetishes of seaweed garlands, horsehair soaked in brine, or vials of sanctified seawater-or of prayers to recite to ward away nuckelavees or convince them the bearer is innocent.

An oceanid can be quite helpful toward mortals and their vessels- particularly if the mortals indulge her extreme vanity. Though silver-tongued people skilled at flattery might earn her help, they might also be lured away to join the oceanid under the sea until she grows bored with them. When an oceanid is in the water, the lower half of her body transforms into a pillar of water, allowing her to swim at incredible speed.

They also work as hired experts for the Aspis Consortium so they can undertake otherwise unaffordable expeditions. Naturally, most Osirionologists place their own motivations above those of their allies, and can be trusted only so long as they are moving toward their goals.",

      "description": "A sensual pairing of seduction and destruction, pairakas embody the corruptive nature of unbridled lust. Pairakas spend little time in their true form while on the Material Plane, choosing to cloak themselves instead in alluring forms to seduce potential victims, ruin relationships, and foment obsession. In its true form, a pairaka's body is a foul landscape of blazing rashes, oozing pustules, and taut blisters suggestive of the corruptions it harbors, bodily and spiritually. Pairakas pride themselves on perversion. They love nothing more than turning lovers against one another or destroying the bonds of friendship. Pairakas feed off this slow torment and savor each broken heart or disappointment. They use lust and sexuality as their primary tools, wielding taboos and carnal appetites to sever once-friendly relationships. Pairakas also use their seduction to spread disease, charming victims into physical contact. Just as all other divs suffer a weakness, pairakas cannot stand the color red. They never wear the color or enter a place that is painted red, and they always attack creatures that are garbed in clothes of a crimson hue first. Pairakas stand 6 feet tall and weigh around 150 pounds. Their skin color varies widely between individuals.",

Swarms of plague locusts can strip acres of crops bare in an hour, and can depopulate small villages in a day as they move through and devour everything in sight. Not only do these ravenous pests rend flesh and savage crops, but they also are noted for destroying buildings and other property. Plague locust bites can scour tiles off roofs and weaken the exposed support beams of sheds and stables (to say nothing of what they do to the camels, goats, and horses within). Osirians thank the gods that plague locust swarms are rare and only stream through in large numbers every few years. Plague locust swarms in other regions are considered to be the work of the demon lord Deskari, especially those found in the northern reaches of Avistan.",

These quills, like those of a porcupine, help protect the small creature but are also dangerous offensive weapons, for the quills hold a deadly poison that animates those it slays as zombies. This necromantic nature, along with their penchant for torment and sadistic ways, makes pukwudgies evil to the core. A pukwudgie stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs a little more than 30 pounds. Pukwudgies are frequently found in the company of undead. This retinue usually consists of zombies and skeletons created via their poisonous quills ability or their ability to animate dead bodies. They have a strong preference for animating the bodies of dead animals over other creatures, and often use undead animals as mounts. A pukwudgie usually stays away from well-traveled areas and humanoid settlements, but may sometimes slip into small villages in the night to steal children. The little horrors enjoy the tender flesh of newborn babies immensely, and are often willing to go through great personal risk to secure infantile repasts when they are available. Their delight in arson only further makes them a bane of small villages.",

An ambush predator, she waits near gaps and weak points in the ice and listens for the footsteps of creatures above, sometimes humming or tapping on the ice like a trapped seal in the hope of drawing the curious within range of her alluring scent. When one grabs a victim, she either drowns her prey, saving the body to eat later, or transforms her prey into a monstrous servant that she treats as her own child-and eventually, as a mate. All qallupilluks are female, but they can reproduce with other aquatic monsters. Their offspring are always qallupilluks. Qallupilluks may craft hovels or lodges from stone or coral on the seabed. A few craft semipermanent homes in the submerged recesses of icebergs. They often know fragments of ancient and obscure natural secrets.",

The beasts use their heat to melt tunnels through ice, tunnels whose smooth glassy sides swiftly refreeze in their wake to create uncommonly stable and numerous mazes.Although the remorhaz has much in common superficially with lesser vermin, the beast is surprisingly intelligent. While not capable of speech, the typical remorhaz has a good grasp of the Giant tongue, and tribes of giants often use this to their advantage to secure allegiances with the great beasts. Frost giants are particularly obsessed with them, for those giants who brave the cruel and deadly burns a remorhaz can inf lict to become \"worm friends\" gain a potent weapon to use against their enemies-an assassin capable of burrowing up through the floor of a glacial keep to strike directly against a frost giant's greatest weakness: fire. Other giants use the beasts as living forges, for their backs are hot enough to melt metal.A remorhaz is 25 feet long and weighs 10,000 pounds.",

They rarely deign to talk with other creatures, often doing so only as a cruel game in which they make more and more outrageous demands until their victims realize the drakes are toying with them or the manipulative drakes grow bored. A rift drake rarely stays on land for long, preferring to circle high above near ominous peaks or spires and roosting in the crevices of the same. When a rift drake spies prey from such heights, it breaks from its flight to dive onto victims, scattering groups and sowing terror with its sudden emergence. With particularly agile foes, a rift drake will use its breath to slow victims first, then pick them off one by one. Rift drakes enjoy the taste of blood, and focus their attacks on the fleshiest-looking creatures. A rift drake is around 14 feet long, end to end. Its burly, spiky body weighs about 2,500 pounds.",

Only one of these abilities is active on a given day, and it only comes into effect when a salikotal kills its intended target with a coup de grace. These executions only function on living creatures. Fideicide: The victim's soul is immediately shunted to a infernal prison on Erebus, the third layer of Hell. The soul can be returned to life, but upon casting the spell, the spellcaster attempting the resurrection takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 x the victim's number of Hit Dice, and must make an immediate concentration check (DC 10 + damage delt + spell level) or lose the spell. Necrocide: After 1d4 rounds, the victim's body animates as a zombie under the salikotal's control. The devil may permanently grant control of the zombie to any sentient creature as a free action. Omnicide: The victim's body is utterly destroyed, disintegrating without a trace. Its clothing and possessions remain unharmed. Only spells that do not require a portion of the corpse may return the victim to life.<br/>Prince-killers and assassins of souls, salikotals serve as the bloody chisels by which the lords of Hell subtly shape the mortal world to their whims. Soaring through the night on silent wings, these murderous devils care nothing for life or reason, knowing only a single, murderous goal. Cloaked by shadow and silence, few ever glimpse the sharp features of a salikotal, for Hell's death-dealers reveal themselves only amid the haze of fading life.Lean, deft hunters, salikotals move like terrible predatory birds, each taloned step measured, cautious, and full of deadly intent. Protected by an armor of sharp, thin scales, these agile devils universally stand 5 feet, 4 inches tall, and weigh 85 pounds, their barbed frames supporting the breadth of their 8-foot-wide, bat-like wings.

      "description": "When residents of the small town of Sandpoint on the southwestern coast of Varisia speak in low voices about \"the devil,\" they mean the dreadful creature that has menaced the community and its hinterlands for over a decade. Then again, most people don't speak of the Sandpoint Devil if they can help it. They say the monster knows when someone is talking about it, and a poor soul who can't hold his tongue is likely to glimpse the creature's grotesque silhouette in the sky on the next moonless night-an ill omen indeed. According to legend, sightings of the Sandpoint Devil presage times of great woe, whether for a single person or the entire town. Sometimes, those who see the creature or speak of it too freely vanish in the night, never to be seen again. Precise descriptions of the Sandpoint Devil vary depending on whom you ask, but most people agree that it resembles a large horse standing upright on its hind legs with leathery, ragged wings; a reptilian tail; red eyes that burn through the gloom; and a fanged muzzle that gives the creature a perpetual evil grin. Some say the devil commands fog and wind, others say it breathes gouts of flame or can literally frighten you to death, and still others say it can do all this and more. Whenever livestock are slaughtered in their pens or children disappear from their beds, townsfolk are quick to blame the Sandpoint Devil. The beast is also denounced (quietly) when a building burns to the ground or a farmer's crops wither. In short, the locals hang nearly all their ills on the devil. But not all residents consider it to be evil. Some believe that the creature is an ancient guardian of the Lost Coast, and its actions in service of that goal, however terrible they might seem, are not for mortals to understand. Of course, hearsay and rumors only go so far, and most people outside the region consider the Sandpoint Devil a tall tale at best. At worst, they say it's a hoax perpetrated by simple folk looking for attention or hoping to draw travelers and adventurers with coin to spend.",

Most of their time is spent roaming the Material Plane, lurking in shadows and places where death and sorrow linger, such as graveyards and ruins. They are wanderers, moving from village to village in search of their next victims. When a target is located, a sangoi (or, rarely, a pair of sangois working together) seeks to isolate the victim in order to murder it and take its form. The sangoi poses as its victim, while draining the emotional, mental, and physical energy out of those that give them succor with its curse of misery. Sangoi consider themselves hunters of a sort, seeking children born with certain unique characteristics or deformities, such as those born covered with a caul, or who bear a particular birthmark or hair or eye color. Sangois fear those with such marks, whatever they might be, believing they render them powerless against such creatures and that if those with the marks are able to grow to maturity, they will bring ruin to the sangoi. Each individual sangoi has its own particular mark it grows to fear. Children so marked are spirited away from their mortal parents and slain, sold as slaves to an evil fey master, or simply imprisoned in the depths of a sangoi's lair, all to quell whatever threat the sangois believe they pose. When such a child is found, a sangoi begins lurking about the home in the guise of an animal and might even take the form of a pet to attract the child's affection. Its curse falls upon the household with this infiltration, though sangois credit their chosen targets with immunity to their powers, or even the ability to block their powers from affecting others. Sangois attempt to abduct their targets at birth when possible, but often they do not discover them until a target is older. In such cases, sangois try to kill or kidnap their targets using dominated wild animals or traps set up to look like natural accidents. Once a victim has been taken, a sangoi changes its shape to assume the victim's form, usually spending several days reading the victim's thoughts or speaking with its corpse to learn about it so it might better impersonate him. The sangoi then returns to the victim's home and assumes its life, going about his daily business while keeping out of direct sunlight when possible, often feigning illness or injury. Once the sangoi enters its victim's home, its curse of misery begins to take hold, sapping the life and spirit from the family and friends of its victim. The sangoi amuses itself with the abuse and murder of domestic animals through traps and magical compulsion, and calls foul weather to cast a pall upon the house while it waits for the family of its victim to slip into ennui. Once those in the house fall into utter despair, the sangoi plans elaborate murders in which it renders its targets helpless, often with traps using common household objects and implements, and then carves out and greedily devours the hearts of its helpless victims, savoring the sour tang of fear that lingers in broken hearts even after death.",

From the ceiling of a sangudaemon's lair, the fiend hangs the cocooned bodies of countless victims, some still barely conscious beneath their grotesque wrappings-bindings made of hardened blood and the eff luvium of devoured and regurgitated souls. A sangudaemon entombs its victims in these fibrous casings like a giant spider does its prey, slowly sucking the bodies dry of both blood and spirit. Sangudaemons keep their lairs underground or at high elevations in order to best preserve the bodies within, though when the cocoons have been completely leeched, the remnants begin to crumble into dust, and such charnel houses eventually fill with the dry, brittle ashes of victims.",

            "description": "While out hunting in either the wastes of Abaddon or throughout other planes, sangudaemons often work in packs of up to 10 individuals, and though they hunt together, they much prefer to keep their own independent lairs to drag victims back to for slower feedings. Other daemons find sangudaemons' potent abilities useful, especially on battlefields where blood is spilt. Piscodaemons and purrodaemons in particular find use for their services, shedding much blood in their destructive rampages and benefiting from sangudaemons' unique and devastating control over spilt blood. While sangudaemons sometimes spawn from the souls of blood-drained victims of vampires, the daemons and the undead share no love for one another, and many sangudaemons openly despise vampires. Some speculate that sangudaemons that hate vampires do so because they themselves were victims to the undead as mortals, and a faint and bitter impression permeates their otherwise vacuous recollection. The contempt some sangudaemons have for vampires often runs so deep that the daemons seek out these undead souls in particular, hoping to utterly consume them, as sangudaemons often find vampires' tainted blood even more delicious than any other creature's. A sangudaemon will at times trade numerous souls and soul gems via Abaddon's markets for just a single vampire's soul, so much do they delight in the obliteration and consumption of the thing. As such outspoken hunters of vampires, sangudaemons often find themselves at odds with the goals of Urgathoa, Abaddon's resident goddess of undeath. Though most daemons would never dream of siphoning some of her destined souls to sate their own hungers, the mere existence of the two polar forces within the blasted lands nevertheless creates an uncomfortable tension between the fiends and the goddess. What the two sides agree on is excessive gluttony, though Urgathoa's followers often partake merely of food, whereas sangudaemons indulge themselves purely on blood. As a caste, sangudaemons have a distinct preference for service to both Apollyon and Szuriel. Those in service to the Horseman of Pestilence live in his festering swamps and frequently incubate various hemorrhagic fevers and blood-thinning diseases within their various pockets of consumed mortal blood, keeping the diseases alive and active until they can be dispersed through new populations for maximum carnage. Szuriel, meanwhile, spreads the plague of war wherever she passes, and thus bloodshed is an inevitability; whether this large-scale bloodletting is brought on by the tip of a sword or the hungering jaws of a sangudaemon matters not to the Horseman of War, and she gladly accepts the services of the eager and hungry sangudaemons, who are driven to ecstatic revels by battlef ield gore.",

      "description": "A sargassum fiend is a free-f loating mass of intelligent seaweed capable of luring its victims to their deaths via a powerful hallucinogenic pheromone. Once the sargassum fiend lures prey within striking distance, it grabs the entranced creature and attempts to crush it to death. Experienced sailors tell tales of entire crews jumping overboard to swim out to a murderous field of the sea plants. The strange pheromone produced by a sargassum fiend can be harvested from the numerous bulbs that grow within the fiend's body, but these bulbs rot quickly once harvested. A fresh bulb lasts for 1 hour before becoming useless; until that point it can be crushed as a standard action to produce a mirage effect as detailed above. A single sargassum fiend generally has 1d6 bulbs of musk when slain-harvesting one requires a DC 29 Survival check. To date, no alchemical or magical process has successfully preserved this musk. Sargassum fiends usually reach sizes up to 10 feet in diameter before splitting, their means of asexual reproduction. Mutations have been known to exist, however, and sea-faring scholars have recorded individual sargassum fiends reaching masses of truly enormous size, up to Colossal. Such enormous sargassum fiends can be created by advancing their Hit Dice by a minimum of 5 HD per size increase step.",

They hate the living and the undead with equal passion, perhaps out of jealousy for those who have a spark of life (even if that spark is provided by a corruption of life in the form of undeath), though they usually ignore creatures from the Outer Sphere. They believe their positive energy counterparts, the jyoti, long ago stole their ability to create, breaking the parallel between the two energy planes and forcing these void-dwellers into an unwanted role of pure destruction. In a way, their hatred parallels that of another native of the Negative Energy Plane-the nightshade. Yet despite their similar goals, the sceaduinars see nightshades as just another corruption of life worthy of destruction- even though very few sceaduinars are powerful enough to directly oppose one of these deadly undead. Sceaduinars are quite intelligent, yet they have no real society to speak of. When they gather together, it is always to form a larger band to strike against a particularly dangerous foe.",

A shantak avoids confrontations with these types of creatures if possible.A shantak's ability to travel the gulfs of space ensures that these scaly, bird-like creatures can be found on numerous worlds. Yet despite this unique ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the gulfs of space.",

In these places of refuge, shedus contemplate the struggle between good and evil throughout the universe. Tireless vehicles of good and kindness, shedus fight against outsiders who corrupt and threaten humanity. Skilled in healing, shedus focus on eliminating plagues, even hunting down outsiders and undead working in that destructive medium. Shedus rarely make their homes near each other. This is not out of any sort of animosity, but rather from a feeling that having two or more shedus within close proximity wastes the opportunity to provide aid to a larger region. When a shedu roams through the lands of another, it always seeks out the local shedu for an opportunity to talk and share knowledge over the course of 3 days. After this period, the visiting shedu departs with a new perspective and more points to ponder in its eternal struggle against the evils of the world.",

The carved figure is coated with the solution and then brought to the shores of the sea and affixed to the bowsprit of the craft it will protect. Only then is the construct's creation finally complete. Unlike with most constructs, however, control of the creature does not fall to the creator, but rather to the captain of the ship to which it is affixed. If the captain of the ship changes, control of the construct passes to the new captain. Although resistant to most hazards of sea and storm, all ship sentinels eventually wear down after a time and require polishing, cleaning, and recoating with the specially prepared varnish used during the construct's creation. If maintained in this fashion, however, a single ship sentinel can guard a ship-passing from captain to captain-for decades or even centuries.",

Their presence is an undisputed boon to all aboard-though most captains prefer not to speak of their crafts' guardians, preferring to keep the constructs as secret weapons. When the sentinel is needed, the captain must shout a word or short phrase to bring the construct to life. An awakened ship sentinel is able to recognize loyal members of its crew, placing them under its protective wards, and directs its attacks against any living targets that it does not ward, though the construct's master can point it toward specific targets. In combat, ship sentinels can pulverize flesh and bone with their heavy wooden hands, but normally wield a weapon of some kind-usually a spear, rapier, shortsword, or other light weapon. Stories even exist of elven vessels that armed their ship sentinels with huge bows, or of daring Brevic sea captains who gave their constructs the fabled Aldori dueling swords of their homeland. Regardless of these variations, most weapons used in a ship sentinel's construction draw upon the construct's inherent nimbleness, an agility belied by the figurehead's wooden form. But whether their weapons are forged or natural, all ship sentinels can infuse the sting of seawater and salt air into their blows, wracking their foes with crippling pain. Ship sentinels are resilient foes, their wooden bodies capable of turning aside most attacks that cannot pierce or gouge them. Unfortunately their construction also makes them vulnerable to fire-their greatest weakness-and any magical fire quickly dries a ship sentinel's body to a nearly immobile brittleness. <br/>",

      "description": "Magically crafted and crossbred from fire giants and stone giants by ancient wizards, slag giants are among the foremost artisans and crafters of giantkind. Proportioned more like stone giants than fire giants, slag giants have long limbs with lean muscles; they stand 14 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds. Slag giants' skin color ranges from a deep and ruddy hue to a rusty orange. Their hair is black, gray, or white, though males and females both tend to keep their hair cropped close or shaved off. Slag giants can live to be 400 years old. Slag giants usually evince a cold, detached attitude about everything other than their work. Their inherent understanding of metalworking and resistance to fire allow them to craft arms and armor from inside their huge forges, sometimes working the metal with their bare hands. Small families of slag giants often ally with clans of other giants, providing masterwork armor and weapons in exchange for ore and the freedom to practice their crafting skills in peace. Even militaristic fire giants (who pride themselves on their strength and martial prowess) respect the fine work of the weaker slag giants, and usually attempt to ally with the artisans rather than enslaving them. Slag giant settlements usually consist of several stone homes (built from or surrounded by forge slag) with built-in forges and large, smoking chimneys. Most are in hills or mountains, but they can be found anywhere there is a ready supply of iron ore. Although they prefer creation to combat, slag giants are brutal and efficient fighters, capable of destroying an enemy's weapons or armor in a few precise blows. They often let opponents retreat if it gives the giants the opportunity to collect any broken weapons and armor as salvage. If approached peacefully, they are willing to barter or sell their goods, though they usually don't have human-sized items on hand. Trespassers who carelessly or wantonly destroy a slag giant's work or foul its forge usually end up in the fire. Most settlements have several giant-sized breastplates the residents can don if they expect a serious fight.",

It is only at night that she assumes her true form, when her wrinkled skin peels back and reveals the monstrosity that lurks within, which seeks the blood of those sleeping, unsuspecting neighbors who know her merely as the eccentric widow living at the edge of town. Soucouyants prefer to capture victims for their cruel experiments when possible, and drain such unfortunates of their blood over a course of days or even weeks to sate their sanguinary appetites. A typical soucouyant is 6 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. The most powerful soucouyants take it upon themselves to further their spellcasting abilities, and usually possess levels as witches.",

There is a 1% chance that instead of turning into slugspawn, a spawning canker transforms into a dark young of Shub-Niggurath (see page 78).<br/>A spawning canker is a terrible dual creature, an unnatural parasite and the decapitated humanoid body its tentacles writhe from like a knot of lashing, aberrant heads. Few ever see a spawning canker without its humanoid armor, but within the chest cavity of these hollowed-out hosts squirms a heartlike body contorting with a misassembled mass of fetal features and trailing a thicket of spiny tendrils. These tendrils lash from the stump of the host body's exploded head, but also riddle the body, taking control of muscles and organs like the strings of some abominable puppet master. The body of a former host is pumped full of strange excretions and reinforced with the tendrils riddling its form, giving what appears to be a crippled frame an unnatural strength and speed. Those tentacles that extend forth serve as both the thing's sensory organs and its feeding tubes, through which a canker drains the essence of other thinking creatures. Once it has gorged itself, a spawning canker erupts in a burst of obscene generation, its body withering with terrible speed, splitting both its own and its stolen essence into tentacles.These limbs split and tear from the remains of the canker's body as writhing, dumb slugspawn, parasitic terrors with no desire but to infest other living creatures and, through their deaths, spread ever more of their terrible kind.A typical spawning canker stands as tall as the humanoid body it infests, plus 2 to 3 feet of added height from its dozen or so wild tendrils.",

These repulsive creatures possess sluglike bodies the color of rotting algae, covered with thick mucus. Vulnerable to the predations of larger creatures, slugspawn rarely venture forth on their own. Although they can move at a speed of 10 feet per round, slugspawn frequently hide themselves in dark pools or shadowy crevices, waiting for the warm flesh and pliant brains they crave to come to them.</br>Upon entering a square with a slugspawn in it (or if attacked by a slugspawn), a creature must make a DC 16 Perception check to note that a slugspawn is something other than a normal slug (though hidden slugspawn can be more difficult to detect). If this Perception check is failed, the slugspawn leaps upon the creature and burrows into its flesh. The creature can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to avoid the slugspawn, but only if the creature is aware of the slugspawn's presence. Any amount of damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation.Once a slugspawn has infested a living body, it burrows toward the host's skull and wraps around the lower brain, growing and feeding upon the energies generated by thought. On the first round of infestation, dealing cold damage to the victim can kill the slugspawn and save the host-but only if the victim takes 10 or more points within 1 round of being infested. Cutting the slugspawn out also works, but the longer it remains in a host, the more damage this method does. Cutting it out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 25 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has been infested. If the Heal check is successful, the slugspawn is removed. After 3 rounds, though, the slugspawn has reached the host's brain and cannot be surgically removed without killing the host. Remove disease kills any slugspawn in or on a host.After a slugspawn has reached a host's brain, it proves to be a beneficial parasite-at least initially. A slugspawn's host benefits from complete immunity to mind-affecting effects, as the slugspawn's presence confuses and devours such magic. This benefit doesn't last for long, though, as after a variable period (typically lasting 2d6 days in humanoids, though sometimes more or less in other creature types) the slugspawn matures into a spawning canker, a new stage in its lifecycle that begins with it violently devouring its host's brain, erupting from its skull, and taking over the beheaded host body-a near instantaneous process that immediately kills the host. The result is a new creature, a spawning canker garbed in its former host's skin. If the host is killed before the slugspawn fully matures, the parasite undergoes a rapid, emergency maturation, taking control of the host body as if it had fully matured-though such spawning cankers rarely prove as long-lived as their fully matured brethren.",

In their alien philosophies, infesting a victim, growing into a canker, and then \"ascending\" is the ultimate glory. While slugspawn have only an instinctual impression of their role in the greater cycle, spawning cankers are true fanatics, obsessed with propagation. While they avoid competing with others of their kind, if resources are limited, each canker seeks to assure that it can spawn. The moits have no interest in rationing humanoid hosts to assure their allies or spawn have the means to reproduce. Instead, they care only for the moment and the immediate potential to spawn. Thus, whole regions might be wiped clean by the infectious invasion of these moits, which grow all the more desperate as hosts and, by extension, opportunities to fulfill their lives' only purpose diminish.",

There are even rumors of yet larger beasts, called whaleeating eurypterids by sailors. Regardless of their size, all share one thing in common-an aggressive attitude. Eurypterids lash out at anything that might be food, and once they've tasted prey, are single-minded in their pursuit. Although quite at home in the open sea, most eurypterids are capable of scuttling around on land and can exist out of water indefinitely. Unlike rats, eurypterids don't spread disease or cause much damage to most cargos-traits that have led some captains to experiment with seeding colonies of ochre eurypterids in their holds to keep rodent populations under control. Alas, one can often tell the ships that use this tactic by the unusually high number of crewmen with missing fingers.",

But while their appearance is somewhat withered, spire drakes are just as strong and ferocious as other drakes. Spire drakes are unusually intelligent for their kind. They are particularly curious about magic and magical items, and enjoy having large collections of such items even if they don't know how to use them. Lacking the ability to detect magic, they often scour their hunting ranges for any items they suspect might be magical, collecting an array of strange and obscure devices and objects and displaying them proudly so they can boast to other drakes they encounter (who often jealously try to steal or destroy the collections of their rivals). Spire drakes often demand tribute from merchants and caravans passing through or near the lands they claim, or may offer to let opponents escape a fight in exchange for surrendering a magic item. Spire drakes are rarely as clever as they think, however, and can be easily tricked by temporary magical effects into believing an item is magical. Still, spire drakes that manage to collect true magical items use them offensively or defensively as appropriate, and love to show off their latest prizes. A typical spire drake measures 18 feet from its nose to the long, thin tip of its tail, and weighs about 1,700 pounds.",

      "description": "Morbid-minded and wretched to look upon, spirit nagas are the witches of the naga race, hateful outcasts long shunned for their dark powers and loathsome ways. A typical spirit naga is slender, with the scales of a venomous serpent and a tangle of greasy hair framing their pale faces. Most measure 14 feet long but weigh less than 300 pounds. Spirit nagas delight in places of death and desolation. Battle-scarred ruins, untended graveyards, despoiled forests, and tangled swamps all attract these repulsive creatures. Where guardian nagas favor places of innate sanctity, spirit nagas seek out places of fundamental corruption, sites they believe to be imbued with dark magics. The crypts of long-dead tyrants, the death places of great heroes, and the ruins of nefarious keeps all attract these wretched serpents. Most spirit nagas believe themselves to be the inheritors of some mysterious dark favor, seeing their innate magical talents as evidence of such. Most commune with vague powers of death and devastation, working profane rites and seeking grotesque auguries from cultic forces. To aid them, spirit nagas often use their enchanting gaze, changing victims into fawning fanatics and would-be sacrifices. Spirit nagas occasionally band together in small groupssome seeming to mimic the covens of hags. While a particular plot or foe might bring these deadly serpents together for a short time, spirit nagas are loyal only to themselves, and such alliances always end in deadly betrayal.",

Storm hags are hateful creatures, and strangely, their hate is one of the few things that brings them pleasure. A storm hag resembles a shrunken old woman with a thundercloud of hair stacked atop her wrinkled head. Her mouth hangs open, revealing thin pointed teeth; small arcs of electricity can be seen jumping across her teeth and spittle. Black talons sprout from her fingertips, likewise crackling with electricity. A storm hag's wrinkled face contains a look of gleeful distaste, and her eyes are thick with cataracts, rendering her gaze pupil-less. A storm hag's hair is wild and unruly with static electricity popping and crackling throughout the mass. Seemingly animated, a storm hag's hair can easily stand as tall as she is. Wiry and stooped, a storm hag weighs about 70 pounds and stands a little over 4 feet tall, though if she stood up straight she could easily reach 5 feet or more. A storm hag usually wears rough furs and coarse woolen clothing that is rarely cleaned, giving her a distinctly unpleasant odor.</br>",

It is unknown why this is so-perhaps storm hags cannot distinguish between children and members of these small races on sight and are angered that their prey is not actually their favorite food.

They prefer areas that are prone to inclement weather, and enjoy flying through the air during thunderstorms, feeling the static discharge dancing across their warty skin. Storm hags most frequently claim territory in the wild spaces between settlements where they keep their distance from civilization unless hunting. Like a predator, a storm hag constantly surveys her territory and takes great pains in keeping a secret den she considers always hers. For the most part, a storm hag is content to remain in one place if the food is plentiful and her shelter is safe and obscured. A storm hag's den is a simple, yet grotesque affair, often located in deep, dark forests or atop craggy mountains, and is always hidden from sight. Cluttered with bones and skins from previous meals, a den's most dominant feature is the storm hag's cauldron. Storm hags roam their territory hunting, preferring to prey on children if possible, but they do consider adult humanoids suitable substitutes when children are unavailable. A storm hag only stoops to eating animals when her hunger grows too strong, however. When a storm hag encounters travelers in her territory, she torments the unwitting visitors, calling down the winds and whipping up a storm of howling gales and crashing lightning to break her enemies' ranks and to send them running for shelter. Once her prey has been cornered into a cave or thicket where they sought shelter from the weather, the storm hag sows discontent by using her whispering wind spell-like ability to harass and frighten the sheltered travelers with a hate-filled, disembodied voice. Like a cat toying with a crippled field mouse, the storm hag pushes her prey to their breaking point-letting them steep in shivering fright-before confronting them face to face with tooth, claw, and lightning before finally killing and consuming them. <br/>",

They prefer to form these covens with other storm hags, but storm hags have been known to team up with green hags or other hags on occasion. Storm hags inhabiting stormy coasts or soggy salt marshes sometimes ally with sea hags and form covens with them. Though they respect the strength of annis hags, few storm hags enter into a coven with those brutish and simple creatures. When they do, the storm hags rely on the annis hags' intimidating physical might to help in their hunts. A storm hag is an attractive prospect for any burgeoning coven-to-be, but these hags aren't easily wooed into joining with others. A storm hag is haughty and views her way of doing something as the best, if only because she is the one doing it. Any hag thinking of forming a coven with a storm hag would do well to ride a fine line between flattery and outright dominance by performing simultaneous acts of humble depravity and honorific evil. The other two hags in a coven with a storm hag gain her child-scent ability as long as they are within 100 feet of the storm hag. In addition, a coven with a storm hag as a member has access to the following spell-like abilities beyond what a normal coven provides: call lightning storm (DC 18), plague storm<sup>UM</sup> (DC 19), quench (DC 16), whirlwind (DC 21), wind wall. Like other covens, all three hags must be within 10 feet of one another and must work together and take a full-round action take part in this cooperative magic.

In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel.

Although technically blind, stygiras have almost supernaturally keen hearing, taste, and touch, and so have no need for sight. What remains of the eyes that lurk as vestigial elements of their anatomy hide beneath the scarred flesh of their faces. While such remnant organs typically go unused, they can still detect the presence of light, an uncomfortable sensation that all stygiras take great pains to avoid. Stygiras can in fact travel under the skies, but they quickly become agoraphobic and retreat to the safety of shadowy canyons or caves as soon as possible. They avoid the sunlight hours, with most willing to face death in the darkness rather than take their chances venturing into the light. All stygiras are female; they are capable of reproducing with humanoids of nearly any species and always bearing three or more withered-and typically stillborn-stygira young.

Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalidies must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits.Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalidies rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metallic-winged avians. Stymphalidies breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalidies are made of steel-like material similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon. Smaller varieties of stymphalidies exist, including a variant with a penchant for swarming, but the towering creature presented here is by far the most commonly encountered of its kind.

Each individual suspiridaemon bears the mark of its particular manner of mortal death-usually in the form of the bruised or mangled flesh of its throat-and the large iron collars around its neck hide such shameful reminders of life, though the suspiridaemon itself is often unaware of this. A suspiridaemon comes into being with the rings already bound around its throat, so that it never witnesses the aff lictions that sent it to Abaddon in the first place. It is thought that should the collars around a suspiridaemon's throat ever be broken, the fiend's head would crook clumsily downward, allowing the monster to see wounds that might remind it of the terrible death it endured in its past existence. Suspiridaemons pride themselves on the number of souls they have deprived of life by strangulation, and this amount often corresponds to the number of iron rings a suspiridaemon wears on its body. While most suspiridaemons are relatively weak compared to their daemonic kin, a particularly skillful individual who is talented at crafting as well as killing can construct iron collars adorned with gem slots, items that give the suspiridaemon the ability to contain the souls of its victims in the rings for trade in the soul markets of Abaddon. When a suspiridaemon is slain, its iron rings disintegrate into ash, and any gems held within are shattered as well, freeing the trapped souls. A suspiridaemon generally uses stealth when confronting foes. Unleashing its long, winding tongue from a dark corner, one of these fiends will strangle an unwary foe in isolation from the rest of the creature's party. When in combat, a suspiridaemon greatly prefers to kill its enemies by its own hands or its barbed tongue, using its arcane abilities and other daemonic gifts to wear down or sow discord into a group of opponents. To a suspiridaemon, there is no act more appreciable than choking the life from a victim, and bringing the creature close to hear its final, distorted gasp. A suspiridaemon prefers to take souls from creatures who are on the verge of death, but aren't quite there yet; the fiend gazes at its victim's expiring face, drawing the dying creature's soul out of it with a solemn suspension of the daemon's normal twitching and convulsing. Those who have witnessed a suspiridaemon draw the life from a creature claim that the fiend almost seems to be inhaling fresh air for the first time as the victim's physical shell expires, and for the briefest moment, the monster appears to breathe normally. The eerie spectacle ends as quickly as it begins, however, as the suspiridaemon sets its gaze upon its next victim, preparing its vicious tongue for another attack.",

            "description": "While many daemons dedicate their loyalty to one of the Horsemen or some other power within Abaddon, either based on their origins, historical ties, or environmental circumstances, no such proclivities exist for suspiridaemons. Suspiridaemons avoid operating under masters whenever possible, preferring more individualistic careers of murder and destruction. They tend to work well with other daemons when forced into doing so, though the more daring individuals tend to stray from Abaddon and gravitate toward population centers on other planes to stalk prey as they please. Suspiridaemons traversing the multiverse in a pack regularly take their small hunting parties into the wilderness around smaller settlements, ravenous in their pursuit of those who stray from the protective gazes of allies. While their killing tactics are as ruthless as any other daemon, suspiridaemons' murders are particularly shrouded in a cold manner of sincere and solemn contemplation, their grisly crimes against souls veiled in a mist of contempt toward the living as well as hatred for themselves. Some speculate that this self-hatred might be connected to the lingering doubts as to their origins, the itch beneath their iron collars that reminds them of their own past mortality. Whatever the cause of their self-doubt, the feeling does not seem to bother most other daemons, who generally view suspiridaemons as useful companions whether inside or outside of Abaddon. Piscodaemons and sangudaemons in particular consider them among the most ideal lesser daemons to command. Suspiridaemons cannot speak, and rarely use their powers of telepathy to communicate, simply nodding discreetly when given a task by a more powerful daemon. This silent subservience only adds to other daemons' general appreciation of their humble and disturbing demeanors, though most are sure to keep the strangling fiends at a distance.",

Fleeing to the Shadow Plane, they formed assassin clans, and now they hire their services to any who pay them. Their payment must be in secrets, bits of occult science, and obscure information to add to their huge, dark libraries in underground warrens hidden away on the Shadow Plane. Svartalfars are extremely interested in knowledge about the realm of the fey. Many fear the svartalfars are searching for a way to finally take their revenge upon those who expelled them. These cold, calculating killers are not swayed by whimsy or deeper passions. They pride themselves on their pitilessness and inability to be bribed or dissuaded from ending a target's life once they've been contracted to do so. Once an assassination is paid for, it's the duty of all the svartalfars of a clan or cabal to make sure it gets done. If a clan or cabal fails, another one will finish the job. Svartalfars seem to feel no love or real friendship. All of their actions are committed for practical reasons-political gain, procreation, or relieving boredom. Focused and utterly unyielding, they are considered by many to be the perfect killers, and their tenacity and mastery over magic and shadows are a death sentence for anyone who has been marked as their quarry.",

The tenebrous worm is the larval stage of the gloomwing (see page 133)-but in a strange reversal, these younger creatures are more dangerous than the adults they grow into. A native of the Plane of Shadow, a tenebrous worm hatches from the body of an unfortunate creature that has been implanted with an egg by a gloomwing. The tenebrous worm is fully grown upon hatching, and immediately begins to scour its environs for flesh to consume.Although the tenebrous worm tends to be relatively palecolored, its internal organs seethe and roil with shadowy energies and dark fluids. As the creature feeds, these shadowy innards begin to grow out of its body, forming strange bristle-like filaments of semisolid shadowstuff not only capable of piercing the flesh of those who would attack the worm, but also possessing a deadly paralytic poison. Additional shadowy fluids constantly seep from the worm's mandibles-when it bites prey, these fluids melt flesh into shadows that the creature can then consume. When a tenebrous worm feeds on enough of this shadowy flesh, the creature seeks out a secluded, shady area (typically just within a cave entrance or in a ruined building) and spins a shadowy cocoon around itself. A tenebrous worm's cocoon exudes the effects of a darkness spell (CL 8th), muting the surrounding light. After a period of several days, the cocoon tears open and a fully grown gloomwing emerges, ready to seek a host for its eggs.",

Tikbalangs mimic sounds to lure explorers off their determined path, even separating a single traveler from his group and kidnapping him. They use their magical abilities to make the forest confusing to those passing through, often weaving illusions around a path to hide important turns or cloaking the entire jungle in an unfamiliar appearance. Sometimes a tikbalang stalks intruders, spying on them from afar or from within the canopies of trees to learn more about its visitors. It then uses its change shape ability to appear as someone familiar to its first victim (such as another member of the group) and leads that person deeper into the woods to become lost. Once the victim is out of hearing range, the tikbalang drags it into a high tree, wraps it in vines, and packs its mouth with leaves and moss to stif le its screams. The tikbalang may eat its prisoner, offer to release it if the other intruders leave, or leave its corpse as a grisly warning to other travelers. Though sinister and always looking to bring ruin to explorers, tikbalangs can be bribed or mollified into allowing safe passage with offerings or the performance of strange rituals, such as singing a song, wearing a shirt inside out, or giving the monster bread and honey. The exact bribe is different each day, and the tikbalang never explains what it wants.",

      "description": "Female lurking rays, known as trappers, are the masterminds of their race. Too large to fly (and often gravid with wriggling young), the intelligent trappers scrape themselves out depressions in the floor of regularly traveled chambers and then lie in them, changing their coloration and texture perfectly to blend with the rest of the floor, and sometimes even creating protrusions in the shape of items they know to be valuable to their prey creatures. When a lulled individual steps onto the trapper's surface, the ray twists itself up around it, smothering and beating its victim senseless before drawing it into its maw for slow digestion. Though quite intelligent even by human standards, trappers devote almost all of their mental faculties to perfectly remembering every sensory detail about their surroundings in order to make their chameleon-like disguises all the more cunning and difficult for their prey to resist. Trappers can grow to be 15 feet from tip to tip, and weigh nearly 2,000 pounds when fully fed.",

      "description": "Treants are guardians of the forest and speakers for the trees. As long-lived as the forests themselves, and seeing themselves as parents and shepherds rather than gardeners, treants are slow and methodical in most things but terrifying when forced to fight in defense of their flock. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of the short-lived races, and have an inherent distrust of change, they have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long, rambling monologues, especially if the pupils express a desire to help protect the wildlands. Yet against those who would threaten the forest, especially loggers who seek to harvest wood for lumber or those who try to clearcut a section of forest in order to build a fort or establish a town, the treants' wrath is swift and devastating. They are particularly gifted at tearing down what others builda trait that serves angry treants well. Treants are primarily solitary creatures, with a given individual sometimes responsible for an entire forest, but they occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share news and reproduce. In times of grave danger, all of the groves in a region may gather for a great months-long meeting called a moot, but such events are exceedingly rare, and millennia may go by between them. The typical treant is 30 feet tall, with a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and weighs 4,500 pounds. Treants tend to resemble the species of trees most common in their woodland territories.",

The tupilaq gains the ability to use that spell as a spell-like ability (CL 7th) three times per day. The tupilaq's creator can inscribe a new spell onto the tupilaq if he wishes, replacing the previous scrimshaw. Inscribing a new scrimshaw requires 24 hours of work and an expenditure of 500 gp in materials. The tupilaq presented here utilizes invisibility in this manner. Erase can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator becomes the target of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case. If a tupilaq's creator is already dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out the nearest living creature and attacks this new target on sight, continuing this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed.",

A tupilaq usually stands 3 feet tall and weighs only 30 pounds. Tupilaqs must be created in secrecy-if any other person discovers the tupilaq is being created, the attempt to build the construct immediately fails. As part of its creation, the creator invites or lures a host spirit to possess the tupilaq. Most often, the animus of a tupilaq is that of a dead child or other small humanoid, and the parity of size between the new vessel and the spirit's previous body is what gives the creature a speed and agility on land and in water that is atypical for most constructs. This trapped spirit is also what makes a tupilaq so savage and murderous. <br/></br>",

      "description": "Upasundas, also called beatific ones, are asuras who devote themselves to martial meditations and physical perfection. Upasundas seek monklike poise and skill, and through it, the ability to deal flawless destruction wherever they go. Their nickname suggests purity, and indeed, each beatific one is an expression of asura purity through devotion to the ideal of annihilation. It is believed that the first upasundas were created from the jealous followers of a man who achieved divinity through his own force of will. Those of his followers who felt abandoned when this new deity ascended to the Great Beyond sought other ways to achieve immortality, and fell pray to one of the asura ranas, who granted them their desire by transforming them into beatific ones. Upasundas never surrender to foes in combat and rarely flee from battle. They hope to increase in skill and wisdom or to die in battle. On either path lies evolution toward a greater understanding of destruction in its countless forms. An upasunda is 7 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds.",

A vanth looks like a black skeleton with ravenlike wings and a mask resembling a vulture's skull. Also known as reapers, angels of death, or amzranei, vanths protect the departed from those wishing to eat or steal their mortal souls, recapture escaped souls trying to flee their assigned fates, and are death's foot soldiers against whatever would disrupt the natural cycle of mortality. They may also guard the dead and death's assets, such as forgotten cemeteries, unattended mausoleums, and sacred groves. A vanth weighs 400 pounds and stands 8 feet tall, though its slumped posture means it can look most adult humanoids in the eye. Vanths are ancient creatures, perhaps predating the current gods of death, and are rumored to be ascended souls of a distant world of death-worshiping soldiers. They rarely speak or show emotion and their hollow voices carry unnaturally far. A vanth's scythe is a badge of its station, ref lecting its role as a harvester of souls. It features symbols in a language that was already lost when the death gods claimed Purgatory. Most outsiders scorn vanths, as the psychopomps have no concern for law, rightfulness, or personal gain- only duty. Vanths view any outsider visiting Purgatory as a potential threat, and stalk angels and demons alike.",

Even after passing through the threshold between planes, a vescavor queen retains this infusion of pure chaos, exuding anarchic energies from within and using this attunement to invigorate itself and its kin. And just like its spawn, a vescavor queen trills a mind-muddling song of the Abyss-an incomprehensible and nonsensical mashing of notes and sounds that befuddles those who hear it. Though queens by name, vescavors are genderless creatures that got their name simply for their ability to birth vescavor swarms. With no desires beyond the base instincts of devouring and destroying, vescavor queens start out as the last remaining members of their swarms, having eaten more than any others in the group-and having devoured other members of the swarm-in blind hunger. It is unknown what causes vescavors to grow within the queen, but some scholars believe that the way the creatures are born from the remnants of the vescavors and other materials is a biological representation of how the Abyss constantly consumes and recycles itself. Aside from the obvious offensive benefits a vescavor queen's acid gland imparts to it, this gland is thought to be a way for the vescavor queen to break down more durable materials for consumption. Vescavor queens also develop abilities that allow them to control their brood swarms and ignore the swarms' constant gibbering and biting. Vescavor swarms are birthed from a leathery, cocoon-like egg sac that the young vescavors eat through in order to break into the world.",

            "description": "Vescavors are native to the darkest corners of the deepest reaches of the Abyss. However, with the opening of the Worldwound, they are no longer relegated to the dark and twisted recesses of that realm. Even so, once through the rift between planes, many vescavors don't travel very far, instead setting up their hives in the Worldwound. To date, no vescavors have been reported more than 100 miles from the border of the Worldwound, though nothing stops their spread like the wardstones do the demons. It is their own complacency and desire for familiar surroundings that keep them in this region and prevent them from spreading far and wide. A single queen presides over a region or nest, with all the swarms in the area falling into its brood, whether or not it actually birthed them. Becoming a vescavor queen relies not on ambition or work-such concepts are alien to vescavors' nature-but on instinct and chance. When a queen dies, vescavors notice the sudden lack of a source of chaos and then disperse. Some nearby swarms move in to feed on the remnants of the queen. The vescavor that consumes the most material from the queen's corpse takes over the mantle as queen, growing into its new size and developing its enhanced abilities within a week. Whether queen for a day or a decade, the vescavor queen is never challenged by vescavor swarms. As long as there is something to eat (which for a vescavor swarm means anything but adamantine), vescavors are content engines of destruction. A vescavor queen's ability to heal other vescavors solidifies its unshakable rule. Being creatures of the Abyss, vescavors can live in nearly any environment, though they often choose areas that are environmentally similar to their natural habitat if they find themselves on the Material Plane. As such, they often make their homes underground or in natural caves, where the darkness suits them. They might even burrow their own tunnels and caves underground if nothing natural suits their preferences. As with the chaos they embody, there is no rhyme or reason to the designs of their self-made lairs-they follow whereever their mouths lead them. A vescavor queen holds off producing new swarms until it has a proper nest. The standard gestation period for a new swarm is roughly 3 weeks, at the end of which the queen lays an egg sac. Though vescavors don't strictly need to eat to survive, their ravenous desire to consume, as well as how readily available and abundant a food source is, can alter the gestation period. Scarce resources can delay hatching from 3 to 4 weeks, or vast quantities of food can hasten the birthing process to a single week between hatchings. Vescavor queens remaining in the Abyss spawn new vescavors at different and completely random intervals, independent of location or availability of edible material.",

If successful, the possession ends, and the vilkacis is driven into an adjacent square and cannot use its bestial possession ability again until the following day.<br/>Beings of pure malevolence and destruction, vilkacis arise from the souls of the most desperate and brutal werewolves as spirits burning with the need for bloodshed and vengeance. Specters of savagery escaped from remains tainted by lycanthropy, vilkacis desire to wear mortal flesh and again revel in the vicious ecstasy of hunting and killing. Some see these beings as malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse-the spirits of the infamous aff liction itself-while others know them as the deathly continuance of lives consumed by lycanthropy. In either case, these ravenous spirit-beasts seek only to garb themselves in the skins of deadly hunters and revel in bloodshed once more.Vilkacis typically look like more savage versions of the werewolves they were in life, appearing in their hybrid forms with exaggerated fangs and claws.",

            "description": "Although a vilkacis exists only in a spectral form, its canopic stone permanently binds the spirit to the Material Plane. So long as the stone exists, the creature remains stuck between life and death, its spirit strangling on its own rage.When a vilkacis seizes possession of a victim, the host takes on an altered appearance ref lective of the beast within its body. The victim undergoes severe physical dysmorphia.Musculature enlarges, posture becomes stooped, and hands curl into gashing claws. The face takes on a bestial appearance. The victim's jaws extend and grow into jagged, wolfish fangs, while the brow thickens and the pupils widen to black pools that radiate a mad, feral stare. In this state, the vilkacis-possessed creature froths with the curse of lycanthropy and can pass the curse on as though it were a werewolf. Although such a possessed creature might pass on the infamous disease, its own transformation typically lasts only a matter of hours. A vilkacis is ever searching for stronger and more vicious hunters to use as tools in slaking its eternal bloodlust; if it finds a particularly promising host, it might visit and possess the favored body again and again for its rampages.",

While they are commonly associated with werewolves, the folklore of many nomadic and nature-worshiping societies contains stories of creatures whose descriptions bear strong resemblance to vilkacis. Most haunt the territories where they were created, staying within range of their canopic stones, and hunting within the lands they prowled in life. However, those with the ability to summon vilkacis usually attempt to direct them toward specific prey. This often proves a dangerous or even fatal proposition, however, and few reports exist of anyone successfully mastering a vilkacis.",

To do this, a spellcaster must prepare a canopic stone, a talisman that typically takes the form of a ceramic totem or amulet bound in silver. Upon creating this object, the bearer can summon a vilkacis once per day. The stone grants no control over the vilkacis, but the creature will not attack or attempt to possess the stone's bearer. Upon being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature's body and go on a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act.Although many vilkacis are purposefully created and employed by evil spellcasters, some manifest spontaneously. These beings wander and rampage as they please, but still are bound to a talisman similar to a canopic stone. This spontaneously created artifact can be utilized by those who discover it and discern its importance in the same way as can a canopic stone created specifically to summon and control a vilkacis, and typically takes the form of the dead werewolf 's skull, the silver weapon that killed the werewolf, or a talisman it bore in life.",

While intelligent, these devils prove fanatically devoted to the causes of their masters, the archdevils, Asmodeus, and Hell itself, drawing on ingrained wells of discipline and faith to mete out the greater will of their overlords. Levalochs are highly prized throughout the Pit for this discipline, held up as epitomes of diabolical warriors second only to the ferocious cornugons, and pointed to throughout the planes as embodiments of the soldier's ideal. Yet this discipline only persists while levalochs remain under orders from more powerful devils. Left to their own devices, each levaloch fancies itself a tyrant by its own right and relishes the opportunity to promote conf lict and bloodshed through petty mortal angst and grudges.</br>While all devils possess anatomies that perpetually baff le mortal scholars, levalochs prove even more enigmatic, having no internal physiology at all. Being little more than living suits of blasphemous chitin and Hell-forged armor, these fiends lack all weaknesses of even infernal flesh and blood, while retaining all of the potent resistances common to their diabolical kin. A levaloch's sentience seems to linger within its armored shell, remaining until that exoskeleton proves too damaged to contain an animating spirit any longer. Should a levaloch's armor be destroyed, the plates of metal and carapace fall to pieces and quickly corrode, revealing nothing more than the strong scent of pitch within. Despite their unusual anatomy, levalochs are still thinking, even cunning creatures.

These fiends hold to their orders not out of dull-wittedness, but out of obsessive obedience to the rule of Hell, as proven by their murderous cunning in battle.</br>On the rare occasions levalochs find themselves left to their own devices, the true intellect of these armored terrors becomes apparent. Capable of shocking changes in personality, a levaloch that might not have spoken a word in its entire existence might prove shrewd and subtle when it finds itself upon the Material Plane, stirring old angers, forging Hellish weaponry, even training mortal warriors in a strategic game of warmongering and open campaigning, all encouraging bloodshed in the name of Hell. They despise the weakness of emotion and the changeability of mortal minds. Thus, they delight in testing themselves against mortal flesh, indulging in massacres and encouraging genocides against such weak, worthless creatures whenever their plots might gain even the slightest benefit from such atrocities.

Appearing as partially organic, partially metallic, warmonger wasps serve the demonic armies as air support in large battles, and the armies of the Worldwound are no exception. Their electricity-based explosions work well on battlefields where demons and mortals clash, as electrical attacks have no effect on demons. It's more accurate to say that warmonger wasps are grown rather than constructed, and while the procedure of crafting these foul constructs is beyond the ken of mortal crafters, spellcasters can conjure them to do their bidding (see below). Warmonger wasps are only intelligent enough to understand simple commands, and only ones universally associated with battlefield conditions. In the Worldwound, a large number of warmonger wasps have been left to their own devices. These \"wild\" wasps buzz through the skies, constantly watching for any non-demons to swoop down on and attack. Cultists and other worshipers of Deskari not escorted by demons are quick to speak in Abyssal and show their unholy symbols when confronted by a flight of warmongers. PCs eager to do the same can convince the wasps to leave them alone with a successful DC 20 Bluff check-provided the attempt is made while speaking Abyssal.

So powerful are the energies corrupting and warping these humanoids that chaotic force continues to leak from their creations and continuously affect the creatures' flesh-forever twisting and mutating them in endless agony. These poor victims have been transformed into warped ones. No two warped ones look exactly alike, although they all share certain common features. They always appear as two to four demonic humanoids awkwardly fused together into a single human-sized monstrosity. While they can have several limbs, they always have four that sport particularly sharp talons. Once a warped one enters combat, the excitement of imminent bloodshed (both that of its victims and of itself ) causes the entropic energies within it to change and mutate. A fight against a warped one is a harrowing experience, for not only do the warped one's physical traits change continuously, these mutations affect and cripple those nearby in devastating ways. As using a warped one in combat adds lots of additional dice rolls to encounters, you may want to \"synchronize\" their fleshwarping and warp-field abilities when using multiple warped ones in battles, so each round they all exhibit the same trait and their warp fields all have the same effect.

      "description": "With mottled scales of blue and green, water nagas' serpentine beauty belies their deadliness. Although doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in common with normal snakes than most of their kind, preferring to be left to their own devices and lashing out at any creatures that would disturb them. A typical water naga measures 10 feet long and weighs 250 pounds. Where many nagas claim particular lairs as their homes, water nagas typically have a number of retreats, migrating from one to the next with the changing of the seasons. These nagas keep elaborate summer and winter lairs, with several favored shelters positioned between these so they can make a circuit of familiar rivers and coasts throughout the year. Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs, water nagas typically attack any that intrude upon their sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all. As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs- usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes-often court the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying flattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride in their roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes and often embellish the stories they've heard with their own fictions-caring little for the repercussions such misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The congeniality of some water nagas does not extend to the entire race, and many unwary souls, even those with only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures' deadly bite.",

The creature moves by expanding and contracting these segments, giving it an incredible range of motion, as well as the capability to scale surfaces with an ease equal to that with which they move across the ground.Weaverworms are also know for their claws' deadly nails, which function more like the stingers or barbs of many insects than weapons alone. These nails contain a potent paralytic fluid that passes into the bloodstream of a weaverworm's victim, leaving it vulnerable to slaughter and ready for consumption. The nails often break off while embedded in the victim's body, where they continue pumping the weaverworm's toxins, filling potential meals with dose after dose of paralytic excretions. Occasionally, those who encounter a weaverworm and flee find themselves paralyzed well after they think they've escaped, again falling into the deadly clutches of the pursuing abomination.The flesh of the creature's underbelly is relatively soft and slightly rubbery, running in shades of sickly brown flesh to pale blue. The exposed carapace is tougher and dotted with thousands of short bristles. Over time the weaverworm adjusts to match whatever environment it dwells in. The upper portion of the creature has a female body, but one disfigured by insectile traits. Such monstrous malformations vary between weavers, though all have deadly claws and heads with a terrible assortment of mandibles, pincers, spines, and segmented eyes. Typically, these appearances are similar to the faces of predatory insects common to the region the weaverworm inhabits, with spider features proving most prevalent, but the visages of horrible mantises and monstrous annelids also arise in warmer climates.",

Typically, once a weaverworm claims a burrow, she remains there for life. In this manner, weaverworms are largely consistent, enough so that they frequently catch the attention of primitive humanoids such as goblins, orcs, or, in particular, ettercaps who believe them the embodiment of various gods or fiends and pay them worship.

Yet this punishment unleashed greater terror than even the Lady of Graves might have imagined. Unknown to the furious goddess and her false worshipers, another divinity had noticed the tragic drama. Urgathoa, goddess of disease and undeath, watched and laughed at the terror wrought by the goddess of prophecy upon her vicious servants. Delighted and inspired, Urgathoa went into the world to wreak a similar horror.The Pallid Princess searched the world over, and among her servants living and undead, found none who displeased her enough to curse as Pharasma had her priestess. So she turned her mind toward granting a rare and terrible blessing. Deep in a tangled forest she happened upon a brood of maggots and lowly worms, and in them found all she delighted in-filth and disease, hunger and life amid the dead. Momentarily delighted, she raised up this terrible swarm and molded them and gave them a single body, terrible but not unlike her favored daughters.The result was a monster, a servant of hungers and foul dooms, part grotesque insect, part poisonous fanatic. And the goddess was pleased.Yet Urgathoa is a fickle goddess; her momentary pleasure soon passed, and she left her terror in the forest, content to let it praise her, yet unwilling to care for its needs or safety.So the weaverworm crawled through the forest, insane and terrifying, preying upon what she could and sowing new generations in fits of atrocity-all the while plucking out Urgathoa's praises upon strands of deadly webbing.",

Little more than flying eaters, these creatures rise singly or in flights, and attack all other living creatures that enter their territory. They are equally at home nestled in shallow burrows beneath sand dunes or resting in the rocky crevices of mountains. When they hunt, they soar upon the high thermals and keep an eye out for potential prey through the stony orbs that serve as their eyes. These bizarre hunters prefer to burrow into the torsos of their victims and consume the blood-rich organs, leaving the corpses' peripheral parts for scavengers. Few that encounter these vicious predators live to tell of it. The skeletal remains of whirlmaws' victims can be identified by the suspiciously circular sections of their torsos missing where the creatures burrowed through and consumed the flesh, bone, and organs in their entirety. The green, gemlike eyes of a whirlmaw are prized by those who seek exotic and dangerous treasures in the desert. It is speculated by some that these mystical orbs are the source of the whirlmaw's natural fire immunity, and alchemists and wizards often use them as components in creating magic items that bestow that form of energy resistance.",

Where typical wights rise from a wide variety of individuals, wight lords rise from the bodies of despotic rulers or ruthless generals. Wight lords haunt the same ancient burial grounds and battlefields their lesser kin dwell in, but wight lords aren't satisfied by simply guarding their haunts against the living. They continue their reign as tyrants in death, ruling over undead armies and often compelling their unliving minions to wage war upon nearby towns or cities, sometimes even at the behest of bold and powerful necromancers.The statistics that are presented above represent the minimum power level of a wight lord. A wight lord can rise from the remains of any cruel or sadistic leader, but those who were higher than 11th level when they perished retain some of their previous life's knowledge-although not all of it.When this occurs, subtract 11 from the creature's previous number of class levels to determine the total number of class levels the wight lord possesses. Assign these class levels to the wight lord in a logical way-if it was a single-classed NPC in life, simply add more levels of that class to the wight lord.Multiclassed characters and those who possessed levels in prestige classes require more creativity in applying the class levels. The goal for building such a wight lord should be to approximate the themes and general abilities the creature had in life.",

These arrangements rarely last more than a few seasons, because no creature is truly safe from a winter hag's irrepressible appetite for warm, raw flesh. An ambitious winter hag might extort a village by causing constant snowfall until they give her children to eat or adults to become her slaves. A typical winter hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds. When a winter hag joins a coven, the coven adds sculpt simulacrum and simulacrum to its spell-like abilities, and any member within 1 mile of the winter hag gains icewalking and snow vision.",

While these eerie flames deal no additional damage, the affected creature glows as per faerie fire and becomes sickened. While under the effects of the witchflame, the victim gains vulnerability to fire and takes half again as much damage (+50%) from fire attacks of any sort. This effect persists for 10 minutes. The supernatural flames can only be extinguished before this duration expires by a break enchantment, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell-the effective caster level of the witchflame is equal to the witchfire's HD (CL 10th for most witchfires). Any creature entering the same square as a witchfire or striking it with a melee attack must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or begin burning with witchflame, even if the attack would not otherwise harm the witchfire because of its incorporeal nature. A bolt of witchflame has a range of 60 feet with no range increment. The save DCs are Charisma-based.<br>When an exceptionally vile hag or witch dies with some malicious plot left incomplete, or proves too horridly tenacious to succumb to the call of death, the foul energies of these wicked old crones sometimes spawn incorporeal undead known as witchfires. These ghostly creatures appear much as they did in life, although the grotesque undead energy that births them makes them appear young and attractive and wreathes their insubstantial bodies in a powerful aura of sickly green flame, a ghostly fire referred to as \"witchflame\" in local legends. Strings of will-o'-wisps are often found in the immediate vicinity of witchfires and are typically led by the undead, leading scholars to speculate that the creatures feed off of a witchfire's flames and fury. <br/></br>",

Though intelligent, these monsters see little need for the company of others. Their method of reproduction is as hideous as their tactic of using corpses as lures, for they implant their parasitic eggs in living hosts, giving their spawn a fresh meal to eat upon hatching.

Xenopterids can be encountered nearly anywhere they can find food, quickly adapting their mimicry to resemble whatever humanoids are most common in a particular region. They can bend their wings to form cowls and cloaks, and they can fold their limbs to imitate humanoids' weapons and armor. A xenopterid's eeriest feature is its mouth-a crude chitinous beak that, when closed, resembles a human face. Up close, the xenopterid's unsettling nature is obvious, but from a distance or in dim light, the creature easily passes for its prey. Because their mimicking abilities require concealment, xenopterids commonly hunt their prey at night. Once a xenopterid captures and kills a victim, it liquefies the creature's remains in order to bring the putrid slurry back to the hive where it stuffs this substance into small spherical capsules the creatures use as food. Some evil races prize these capsules, and make gruesome liquors by fermenting the contents. Xenopterids live in colonies in abandoned ruins, old castles, decrepit farmsteads, and similarly abandoned human structures. A colony typically consists of 19 to 28 sterile drones and a fertile hive king and hive queen (xenopterids with the advanced creature simple template). Each colony has only one fertile male, so xenopterids reproduce slowly. Still, the only way to destroy a xenopterid colony is to kill both the king and the queen, and neither one of them ever leaves the safety of the hive. Xenopterid drones become fiercely aggressive when defending the hive against invaders.",

To escape their doomed planet, they cast their minds through time and space, eventually coming to rest in the strange, alien bodies they possess today. While these strange beings now reside in a distant galaxy, the yithians make use of their ability to astrally project to explore other planets, eager to find new worlds to explore. When a yithian arrives upon a new world, it often swaps minds with the creatures it encounters there so as to experience that world as if it were a native. Those who spend time in a yithian's body rarely tell of the strange times they have experienced, for yithians guard themselves well, and leave those they use in this manner amnesiacs who remember the truth only as fragmentary nightmares.",

Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear. Black dragons tend to make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in caves at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile up their filthy treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck.Black dragons prefer their food a bit rotten and will often allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before consuming it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay, making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects made from stone or metal.",

While its powerful jaws and claws are equally capable of taking down opponents, the yrthak generally prefers to wheel through the sky on its membranous wings, firing bolt after bolt of sound into its prey, and exulting in the thrill of the hunt. An adult yrthak is 20 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.Yrthaks spend most of their time aloft-a yrthak hunt often lasts several days, with the yrthak skimming roughly 100 feet over the ground in its wide-ranging search for live prey, only resorting to grazing on carrion in direst need. While they have near-human intelligence, yrthaks generally do not seem interested in forming societies of their own-although the sight of a clutch of yrthaks tormenting a captured morsel might seem to indicate otherwise.",

She roams the wilderness, constantly searching for intelligent creatures to kill and always appearing surrounded by swirling mists of snow and ice. Eternally jaded by her unjust departure to the afterlife, a yuki-onna seeks to impose the same cruel fate upon those who still live, particularly men and those who sympathize or cooperate with them. Many foolish individuals are lured to their deaths by a yuki-onna's unparalleled beauty, which remains even as the evil spirit steadily freezes and kills her victims with her powers over frost. The transition from life to undeath corrupts a yuki-onna's soul, and even a well-intentioned, good-hearted individual who freezes in the snow may become a treacherous yuki-onna. Most yuki-onnas immediately seek out those who wronged them in life, after which they reside in an area near what was their home, haunting and killing anyone who dares to come near. Yuki-onnas hardly ever make their presences known in rural areas with larger populations, and they prefer inhabiting the countryside and wilderness. When a yuki-onna is destroyed, her body melts as though ice, leaving only a small pool of water in its stead. A yuki-onna is 5-1/2 feet tall.",

Rather, a zelekhut is content to enforce the laws of any given society, and while it might hunt a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, it will not shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are 10 times worse, so long as the atrocities are within her technical rights as ruler.

      "description": "The primordial zeuglodon is often mistaken for a dinosaur or other large reptile, in part because of its almost crocodilian mouth as well as its snake-like elongation. Despite these features, it is more closely related to whales and other cetaceans than either aquatic reptiles or fish. A zeuglodon moves through the water with a vertical anguiliform (eel-like) motion that seems almost to be a primitive version of the efficient fluke-driven locomotion of its cetacean relatives. Zeuglodons breathe air through blowholes on the tops of their heads, though they lack the lung capacity to stay underwater for as long as their more evolved kin. The relative dimensions of their angular heads are too small to encase the enlarged brains or melons developed by other cetaceans for echolocation or communication with others of their kind, and as such zeuglodons are less social than whales and dolphins. What they lack in specialized anatomy, however, they make up for in sheer ferocity and speed. A hunting zeuglodon is a furious foe to contend with. An adult zeuglodon measures around 50 feet long and weighs upward of 50,000 pounds.",
